This note surveys the recent developments that establish the fundamental limits for community detection in the SBM, both with respect to information-theoretic and computational thresholds, and for various recovery requirements such as exact, partial and weak recovery (a.k.a., detection). The main results discussed are the phase transitions for exact recovery at the Chernoff-Hellinger threshold, the phase transition for weak recovery at the Kesten- Stigum threshold, the optimal distortion-SNR tradeoff for partial recovery, the learning of the SBM parameters and the gap between information-theoretic and computational thresholds. The note also covers some of the algorithms developed in the quest of achieving the limits, in particular two-round algorithms via graph-splitting, semi-definite programming, linearized belief propagation, classical and nonbacktracking spectral methods. A few open problems are also discussed.},

Acutely aware of the need for rigor, the student is much better prepared to understand what constitutes a proper mathematical proof and how to write one.Fifteen years of classroom experience with the first edition of Understanding Analysis have solidified and refined the central narrative of the second edition. Roughly 150 new exercises join a selection of the best exercises from the first edition, and three more project-style sections have been added. Investigations of Euler's computation of {$\zeta$}(2), the Weierstrass Approximation \- Theorem, and the gamma function are now among the book's cohort of seminal results serving as motivation and payoff for the beginning student to master the methods of analysis.},

Monitoring changes in the covariance matrix of a multivariate process is often used for monitoring process variability under the assumption that only a few elements in the covariance matrix are changed simultaneously from the in-control values. The existing LASSO-based covariance monitoring charts in the high-dimensional settings provide good performance in detecting some shift patterns depending on the prespecified tuning parameter. In practice, control charts that perform reasonably well over various shift patterns are desired when shift patterns are unknown. In this article, we propose a control chart based on an adaptive LASSO-thresholding for monitoring changes in the covariance matrix. The performance of the proposed chart, which is called the ALT-norm chart, is evaluated for various shift patterns and compared with the existing penalized likelihood-based methods. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed chart. Finally, we illustrate the advantages of the ALT-norm chart through simulated and real data from both the semiconductor industry and a high-dimensional milling process.},

Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

  abstract = {Principal component regression (PCR) is a simple, but powerful and ubiquitously utilized method. Its effectiveness is well established when the covariates exhibit low-rank structure. However, its ability to handle settings with noisy, missing, and mixed-valued, that is, discrete and continuous, covariates is not understood and remains an important open challenge. As the main contribution of this work, we establish the robustness of PCR, without any change, in this respect and provide meaningful finite-sample analysis. To do so, we establish that PCR is equivalent to performing linear regression after preprocessing the covariate matrix via hard singular value thresholding (HSVT). As a result, in the context of counterfactual analysis using observational data, we show PCR is equivalent to the recently proposed robust variant of the synthetic control method, known as robust synthetic control (RSC). As an immediate consequence, we obtain finite-sample analysis of the RSC estimator that was previously absent. As an important contribution to the synthetic controls literature, we establish that an (approximate) linear synthetic control exists in the setting of a generalized factor model, or latent variable model; traditionally in the literature, the existence of a synthetic control needs to be assumed to exist as an axiom. We further discuss a surprising implication of the robustness property of PCR with respect to noise, that is, PCR can learn a good predictive model even if the covariates are tactfully transformed to preserve differential privacy. Finally, this work advances the state-of-the-art analysis for HSVT by establishing stronger guarantees with respect to the l2,{$\infty$} -norm rather than the Frobenius norm as is commonly done in the matrix estimation literature, which may be of interest in its own right.},

Finally, an optimal allocation scheme for a large class of distributions which includes members of the exponential family is illustrated. {$>$}},

Many algorithms are now available for this well-studied problem. One of the earliest algorithms, given by W. R. Thompson, dates back to 1933. This algorithm, referred to as Thompson Sampling, is a natural Bayesian algorithm. The basic idea is to choose an arm to play according to its probability of being the best arm. Thompson Sampling algorithm has experimentally been shown to be close to optimal. In addition, it is efficient to implement and exhibits several desirable properties such as small regret for delayed feedback. However, theoretical understanding of this algorithm was quite limited. In this paper, for the first time, we show that Thompson Sampling algorithm achieves logarithmic expected regret for the multi-armed bandit problem. More precisely, for the two-armed bandit problem, the expected regret in time \$T\$ is \$O(\textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash ln T\}\{\textbackslash Delta\} + \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash Delta\^3\})\$. And, for the \$N\$-armed bandit problem, the expected regret in time \$T\$ is \$O([(\textbackslash sum\_\{i=2\}\^N \textbackslash frac\{1\}\{\textbackslash Delta\_i\^2\})\^2] \textbackslash ln T)\$. Our bounds are optimal but for the dependence on \$\textbackslash Delta\_i\$ and the constant factors in big-Oh.},

By leveraging the Bayesian Central Limit Theorem, we extend the SGLD algorithm so that at high mixing rates it will sample from a normal approximation of the posterior, while for slow mixing rates it will mimic the behavior of SGLD with a pre-conditioner matrix. As a bonus, the proposed algorithm is reminiscent of Fisher scoring (with stochastic gradients) and as such an efficient optimizer during burn-in.},

  abstract = {A vast literature in statistics, biometrics, and econometrics is concerned with the analysis of binary and polychotomous response data. The classical approach fits a categorical response regression model using maximum likelihood, and inferences about the model are based on the associated asymptotic theory. The accuracy of classical confidence statements is questionable for small sample sizes. In this article, exact Bayesian methods for modeling categorical response data are developed using the idea of data augmentation. The general approach can be summarized as follows. The probit regression model for binary outcomes is seen to have an underlying normal regression structure on latent continuous data. Values of the latent data can be simulated from suitable truncated normal distributions. If the latent data are known, then the posterior distribution of the parameters can be computed using standard results for normal linear models. Draws from this posterior are used to sample new latent data, and the process is iterated with Gibbs sampling. This data augmentation approach provides a general framework for analyzing binary regression models. It leads to the same simplification achieved earlier for censored regression models. Under the proposed framework, the class of probit regression models can be enlarged by using mixtures of normal distributions to model the latent data. In this normal mixture class, one can investigate the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to the choice of "link function," which relates the linear regression estimate to the fitted probabilities. In addition, this approach allows one to easily fit Bayesian hierarchical models. One specific model considered here reflects the belief that the vector of regression coefficients lies on a smaller dimension linear subspace. The methods can also be generalized to multinomial response models with \$J {$>$} 2\$ categories. In the ordered multinomial model, the J categories are ordered and a model is written linking the cumulative response probabilities with the linear regression structure. In the unordered multinomial model, the latent variables have a multivariate normal distribution with unknown variance-covariance matrix. For both multinomial models, the data augmentation method combined with Gibbs sampling is outlined. This approach is especially attractive for the multivariate probit model, where calculating the likelihood can be difficult.}

  abstract = {There has been a dramatic growth in the development and application of Bayesian inferential methods. Some of this growth is due to the availability of powerful simulation-based algorithms to summarize posterior distributions. There has been also a growing interest in the use of the system R for statistical analyses. R's open source nature, free availability, and large number of contributor packages have made R the software of choice for many statisticians in education and industry. Bayesian Computation with R introduces Bayesian modeling by the use of computation using the R language. The early chapters present the basic tenets of Bayesian thinking by use of familiar one and two-parameter inferential problems. Bayesian computational methods such as Laplace's method, rejection sampling, and the SIR algorithm are illustrated in the context of a random effects model. The construction and implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is introduced. These simulation-based algorithms are implemented for a variety of Bayesian applications such as normal and binary response regression, hierarchical modeling, order-restricted inference, and robust modeling. Algorithms written in R are used to develop Bayesian tests and assess Bayesian models by use of the posterior predictive distribution. The use of R to interface with WinBUGS, a popular MCMC computing language, is described with several illustrative examples. This book is a suitable companion book for an introductory course on Bayesian methods and is valuable to the statistical practitioner who wishes to learn more about the R language and Bayesian methodology. The LearnBayes package, written by the author and available from the CRAN website, contains all of the R functions described in the book. The second edition contains several new topics such as the use of mixtures of conjugate priors and the use of Zellner's g priors to choose between models in linear regression. There are more illustrations of the construction of informative prior distributions, such as the use of conditional means priors and multivariate normal priors in binary regressions. The new edition contains changes in the R code illustrations according to the latest edition of the LearnBayes package. Jim Albert is Professor of Statistics at Bowling Green State University.

  abstract = {A fundamental problem with all process monitoring techniques is the requirement of a large Phase-I data set to establish control limits and overcome estimation error. This assumption of having a large Phase-I data set is very restrictive and often problematic, especially when the sampling is expensive or not available, eg, time-between-events (TBE) settings. Moreover, with the advancement in technology, quality practitioners are now more interested in online process monitoring. Therefore, the Bayesian methodology not only provides a natural solution for sequential and adaptive learning but also addresses the problem of a large Phase-I data set for setting up a monitoring structure. In this study, we propose Bayesian control charts for TBE assuming homogenous Poisson process. In particular, a predictive approach is adopted to introduce predictive limit control charts. Beside the Bayesian predictive Shewhart charts with dynamic control limits, a comparison of the frequentist sequential charts, designed by using unbiased and biased estimator of the process parameter, is also a part of the present study. To assess the predictive TBE chart performance in the presence of practitioner-to-practitioner variability, we use the average of the average run length (AARL) and the standard deviation of the in-control run length (SDARL).},

  abstract = {Statistical quality control is an integral part of modern manufacturing, and control charts are widely used to improve and control the performance of a process. However, much of the work related to process monitoring has been done using frequentist approaches, whereas the Bayesian methodology has a practical advantage in process monitoring; that is, it can be used with a small phase-I dataset. In this article, we considered different symmetric and asymmetric loss functions for designing Bayesian control charts and noticed that the performance of the Bayesian charts is biased, i.e., in-control performance of the charts is not equal to the desired value for some loss functions and comparison among different Bayesian charts can be misleading. Therefore, to get the desired in-control performance under different loss functions, we propose a corrected design of the Bayesian control charts. In addition to posterior charts, we also discuss a predictive control chart to monitor the future observations in this study. Besides a simulation study, we also present two real data examples: the first example is to monitor the surface roughness of reamed holes in a particular metal part while the second is about monitoring the measurements of a diameter.},

  abstract = {Why are some countries rich and others poor? In 1500, the income differences were small, but they have grown dramatically since Columbus reached America. Since then, the interplay between geography, globalization, technological change, and economic policy has determined the wealth and poverty of nations. The industrial revolution was Britain's path breaking response to the challenge of globalization. Western Europe and North America joined Britain to form a club of rich nations by pursuing four polices-creating a national market by abolishing internal tariffs and investing in transportation, erecting an external tariff to protect their fledgling industries from British competition, banks to stabilize the currency and mobilize domestic savings for investment, and mass education to prepare people for industrial work.  Together these countries pioneered new technologies that have made them ever richer. Before the Industrial Revolution, most of the world's manufacturing was done in Asia, but industries from Casablanca to Canton were destroyed by western competition in the nineteenth century, and Asia was transformed into 'underdeveloped countries' specializing in agriculture. The spread of economic development has been slow since modern technology was invented to fit the needs of rich countries and is ill adapted to the economic and geographical conditions of poor countries. A few countries - Japan, Soviet Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and perhaps China - have, nonetheless, caught up with the West through creative responses to the technological challenge and with Big Push industrialization that has achieved rapid growth through investment coordination. Whether other countries can emulate the success of East Asia is a challenge for the future.

Unlike previous controversies over western-led interventions, a major power has used force to expand its territorial sphere. Russia's actions contradict its traditional focus on UN Charter principles and sovereignty in the wider international system. This article questions whether Russia has a serious agenda to gain support for revised understandings of international law, at least as applied to what it views as a Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region of entitlements. Or is Russia driven more by realpolitik, whereby legal discourse contributes to a strategic effort to force changes in the European territorial order, in the first instance in its direct neighbourhood? These uncertainties are contrasted to Russia's single-minded narrative on the threat of regime change. Moscow uses the spectre of `colour revolutions' to influence a variety of states in the wider international system. Overall, so far Russia has failed to shift legal understandings in its favour over Crimea/Ukraine. Yet it continues to view the CIS states as only partly sovereign, as located in a zone of exception. Moscow seems intent on changing the European security and territorial order in its favour, regardless of the language of legal principles it deploys in its wider international diplomacy.},

Current methods to quantify it are often heuristic, make strong assumptions on the label sets across the tasks, and many are architecture-dependent, relying on task-specific optimal parameters (e.g., require training a model on each dataset). In this work we propose an alternative notion of distance between datasets that (i) is model-agnostic, (ii) does not involve training, (iii) can compare datasets even if their label sets are completely disjoint and (iv) has solid theoretical footing. This distance relies on optimal transport, which provides it with rich geometry awareness, interpretable correspondences and well-understood properties. Our results show that this novel distance provides meaningful comparison of datasets, and correlates well with transfer learning hardness across various experimental settings and datasets.},

This chart was proposed by Cappizzi and Masarotto (2003) to achieve a reasonable performance for both small and large shifts. Cappizzi and Masarotto (2003) used a pair of shifts in designing their control chart. In this study, however, the process mean shift is considered as a random variable with a certain probability distribution and the AEWMA control chart is optimized for a wide range of mean shifts according to that probability distribution and not just for a pair of shifts. Using the Markov chain technique, the results show that the new optimization design can improve the performance of the AEWMA control chart from an overall point of view relative to the various designs presented by Cappizzi and Masarotto (2003). Optimal design parameters that achieve the desired in-control average run length (ARL) are computed in several cases and formulas used to find approximately their values are given. Using these formulas, the practitioner can compute the optimal design parameters corresponding to any desired in-control ARL without the need to apply the optimization procedure. The results obtained by these formulas are very promising and would particularly facilitate the design of the AEWMA control chart for any in-control ARL value.},

In practice, however, monitored data could be of a discrete-type. We aim in this study to propose a discrete-version from the AEWMA chart; namely the Poisson AEWMA chart. The chart is compared with its counterparts; the Poisson EWMA chart and Poisson CUSUM chart using the ARL and RMI metrics. Our results show that the Poisson AEWMA chart performs more efficiently in detecting shifts of various sizes with an RMI value approaching zero. The Poisson CUSUM chart has the worst performance. Moreover, the proposed Poisson AEWMA chart is capable of detecting shifts faster than an approach based on normal approximation even for large values of the mean defects. In addition, the superiority of the Poisson AEWMA chart in diminishing the inertia effect is illustrated through a numerical example. The example shows that the Poisson AEWMA chart is capable of detecting out of control situations very fast even if the chart statistic is in a disadvantageous position before a shift occurs.},

  abstract = {The batch least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) has well-documented merits for estimating sparse signals of interest emerging in various applications, where observations adhere to parsimonious linear regression models. To cope with linearly growing complexity and memory requirements that batch Lasso estimators face when processing observations sequentially, the present paper develops a recursive Lasso algorithm that can also track slowly-varying sparse signals of interest. Performance analysis reveals that recursive Lasso can either estimate consistently the sparse signal's support or its nonzero entries, but not both. This motivates the development of a weighted version of the recursive Lasso scheme with weights obtained from the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm. The resultant RLS-weighted Lasso algorithm provably estimates sparse signals consistently. Simulated tests compare competing alternatives and corroborate the performance of the novel algorithms in estimating time-invariant and tracking slow-varying signals under sparsity constraints.},

Following the literature on local maximum likelihood estimation, our method considers a weighted set of nearby training examples; however, instead of using classical kernel weighting functions that are prone to a strong curse of dimensionality, we use an adaptive weighting function derived from a forest designed to express heterogeneity in the specified quantity of interest. We propose a flexible, computationally efficient algorithm for growing generalized random forests, develop a large sample theory for our method showing that our estimates are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian, and provide an estimator for their asymptotic variance that enables valid confidence intervals. We use our approach to develop new methods for three statistical tasks: non-parametric quantile regression, conditional average partial effect estimation, and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation via instrumental variables. A software implementation, grf for R and C++, is available from CRAN.},

The traditional approach to a ?rst course in measure theory, such as in Royden (1988), is to teach the Lebesgue measure on the real line, then the p di?erentation theorems of Lebesgue, L -spaces on R, and do general m- sure at the end of the course with one main application to the construction of product measures. This approach does have the pedagogic advantage of seeing one concrete case ?rst before going to the general one. But this also has the disadvantage in making many students' perspective on m- sure theory somewhat narrow. It leads them to think only in terms of the Lebesgue measure on the real line and to believe that measure theory is intimately tied to the topology of the real line. As students of statistics, probability, physics, engineering, economics, and biology know very well, there are mass distributions that are typically nonuniform, and hence it is useful to gain a general perspective. This book attempts to provide that general perspective right from the beginning. The opening chapter gives an informal introduction to measure and integration theory. It shows that the notions of ?-algebra of sets and countable additivity of a set function are dictated by certain very na- ral approximation procedures from practical applications and that they are not just some abstract ideas.},

We discuss implementation considerations for each method and show their performance through simulations for a real data set. In addition, we examine, through simulations, the robustness of the CUSUM-based method when the rare event model is not exactly known but belongs to a known class of models.},

A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

This debate has surfaced with some vigour over Russia's policy in the Syria conflict where, in order to protect its strategic interests in Syria, an obstructionist Moscow has been accused of ignoring humanitarian considerations and allowing time for the Assad regime to crush the opposition by vetoing a resolution threatening to impose sanctions. While Russian approaches are undoubtedly explained by a desire to maximize its growing political influence and trade advantages to serve its legitimate foreign policy interests, and while Moscow's attitudes to intervention and R2P exhibit important differences from those of the major western liberal democracies, its arguments are in fact framed within a largely rational argument rooted in `traditional' state-centred international law. This article first highlights key arguments in the scholarly literature on intervention and R2P before going on to examine the evolution of Russian views on these issues. The analysis then focuses on the extent to which Moscow's arguments impact on international legal debates on the Libya and Syria conflicts. The article then seeks to explore how Russian approaches to intervention/R2P reflect fundamental trends in its foreign policy thinking and its quest for legitimacy in a negotiated international order. Finally, it attempts to raise some important questions regarding Russia's role in the future direction of the intervention/R2P debates.},

Therefore, these analyses emphasize the inherent nature of, and the in-built contradictions within, Islamism. Far less has been written about the environment external to the phenomenon of Islamism, namely, the milieu in which Islamist groups operate and propagate their ideology. Moreover, only a minuscule portion of the writings on political Islam try explicitly to analyse the impact that variables external to the inherent characteristics of political Islam are likely to have on Islamism's future prospects.

  abstract = {An integral part of the design of control charts, including the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control chart, is the determination of the appropriate control limits for prospective monitoring. Methods using Markov chain analyses, integral equations, and simulation have been proposed to determine the MEWMA chart limits when the limits are based on a specified in-control average run length (ARL) value. A drawback of the usual approach is that the conditional false alarm rate (CFAR) for these charts varies over time in what might be in an unexpected and undesirable way. We define the CFAR as the probability of a false alarm given no previous false alarm. We do not condition on the results of a Phase I sample, as done by others, in studies of the effect of estimation error on control chart performance. We propose the use of dynamic probability control limits (DPCLs) to keep the CFAR constant over time at a specified value. The CFAR at any time, however, could be controlled to be any specified value using our approach. Using simulation, we determine the DPCLs for the MEWMA control chart being used to monitor the mean vector with an assumed known variance-covariance matrix. We consider cases where the sample size is both fixed and time-varying. For varying sample sizes, the DPCLs adapt automatically to any change in the sample size distribution. In all cases, the CFAR is held closely to a fixed value and the resulting in-control run length performance follows closely to that of the geometric distribution.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

We further extend the SSGL to sparse generalized additive models (GAMs), thereby introducing the first nonparametric variant of the spike-and-slab lasso methodology. Our model simultaneously performs group selection and estimation, while our fully Bayes treatment of the mixture proportion allows for model complexity control and automatic self-adaptivity to different levels of sparsity. We develop theory to uniquely characterize the global posterior mode under the SSGL and introduce a highly efficient block coordinate ascent algorithm for maximum a posteriori estimation. We further employ de-biasing methods to provide uncertainty quantification of our estimates. Thus, implementation of our model avoids the computational intensiveness of Markov chain Monte Carlo in high dimensions. We derive posterior concentration rates for both grouped linear regression and sparse GAMs when the number of covariates grows at nearly exponential rate with sample size. Finally, we illustrate our methodology through extensive simulations and data analysis. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In the frequentist setting, penalized likelihood methods are the most popular approach for variable selection and estimation in high-dimensional data. In the Bayesian framework, spike-and-slab methods are commonly used as probabilistic constructs for high-dimensional modeling. Within the context of linear regression, Rockova and George (2018) introduced the spike-and-slab LASSO (SSL), an approach based on a prior which provides a continuum between the penalized likelihood LASSO and the Bayesian point-mass spike-and-slab formulations. Since its inception, the spike-and-slab LASSO has been extended to a variety of contexts, including generalized linear models, factor analysis, graphical models, and nonparametric regression. The goal of this paper is to survey the landscape surrounding spike-and-slab LASSO methodology. First we elucidate the attractive properties and the computational tractability of SSL priors in high dimensions. We then review methodological developments of the SSL and outline several theoretical developments. We illustrate the methodology on both simulated and real datasets.},

  abstract = {Clinical attachment level (CAL) is regarded as the most popular measure to assess periodontal disease (PD). These probed tooth-site level measures are usually rounded and recorded as whole numbers (in mm) producing clustered (site measures within a mouth) error-prone ordinal responses representing some ordering of the underlying PD progression. In addition, it is hypothesized that PD progression can be spatially-referenced, i.e., proximal tooth-sites share similar PD status in comparison to sites that are distantly located. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian multivariate probit framework for these ordinal responses where the cut-point parameters linking the observed ordinal CAL levels to the latent underlying disease process can be fixed in advance. The latent spatial association characterizing conditional independence under Gaussian graphs is introduced via a nonparametric Bayesian approach motivated by the probit stick-breaking process, where the components of the stick-breaking weights follows a multivariate Gaussian density with the precision matrix distributed as G-Wishart. This yields a computationally simple, yet robust and flexible framework to capture the latent disease status leading to a natural clustering of tooth-sites and subjects with similar PD status (beyond spatial clustering), and improved parameter estimation through sharing of information. Both simulation studies and application to a motivating PD dataset reveal the advantages of considering this flexible nonparametric ordinal framework over other alternatives.},

  abstract = {Summary. With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.},

However, one of their practical limitations is expensive computation, typically on the order of n3 where n is the number of data points, in performing the necessary matrix inversions. For large datasets, storage and processing also lead to computational bottlenecks, and numerical stability of the estimates and predicted values degrades with increasing n. Various methods have been proposed to address these problems, including predictive processes in spatial data analysis and the subset-of-regressors technique in machine learning. The idea underlying these approaches is to use a subset of the data, but this raises questions concerning sensitivity to the choice of subset and limitations in estimating fine-scale structure in regions that are not well covered by the subset. Motivated by the literature on compressive sensing, we propose an alternative approach that involves linear projection of all the data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace. We demonstrate the superiority of this approach from a theoretical perspective and through simulated and real data examples.},

This paper introduces the knockoff filter, a new variable selection procedure controlling the FDR in the statistical linear model whenever there are at least as many observations as variables. This method achieves exact FDR control in finite sample settings no matter the design or covariates, the number of variables in the model, or the amplitudes of the unknown regression coefficients, and does not require any knowledge of the noise level. As the name suggests, the method operates by manufacturing knockoff variables that are cheap\textemdash their construction does not require any new data\textemdash and are designed to mimic the correlation structure found within the existing variables, in a way that allows for accurate FDR control, beyond what is possible with permutation-based methods. The method of knockoffs is very general and flexible, and can work with a broad class of test statistics. We test the method in combination with statistics from the Lasso for sparse regression, and obtain empirical results showing that the resulting method has far more power than existing selection rules when the proportion of null variables is high.},

We present a novel approach to detect sets of most recent changepoints in such panel data that aims to pool information across time-series, so that we preferentially infer a most recent change at the same time-point in multiple series. Our approach is computationally efficient as it involves analysing each time-series independently to obtain a profile-likelihood like quantity that summarizes the evidence for the series having either no change or a specific value for its most recent changepoint. We then post-process this output from each time-series to obtain a potentially small set of times for the most recent changepoints, and, for each time, the set of series that has their most recent changepoint at that time. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method on two datasets: forecasting events in a telecommunications network and inference about changes in the net asset ratio for a panel of US firms.},

  abstract = {The use in statistical theory of approximate arguments based on such methods as local linearization (the delta method) and approxi\- mate normality has a long history. Such ideas play at least three roles. First they may give simple approximate answers to distributional problems where an exact solution is known in principle but difficult to implement. The second role is to yield higher-order expansions from which the accuracy of simple approximations may be assessed and where necessary improved. Thirdly the systematic development of a theoretical approach to statistical inference that will apply to quite general families of statistical models demands an asymptotic formulation, as far as possible one that will recover 'exact' results where these are available. The approximate arguments are developed by supposing that some defining quantity, often a sample size but more generally an amount of information, becomes large: it must be stressed that this is a technical device for generating approximations whose adequacy always needs assessing, rather than a 'physical' limiting notion. Of the three roles outlined above, the first two are quite close to the traditional roles of asymptotic expansions in applied mathematics and much ofthe very extensive literature on the asymptotic expansion of integrals and of the special functions of mathematical physics is quite directly relevant, although the recasting of these methods into a probability mould is quite often enlightening.},

  abstract = {Generative models can be used, as an alternative to conventional probability densities, to capture the statistical behavior of complicated datasets. Unlike probability densities with which the generation of realizations may become a challenging task, generative models have an inherent ability to easily produce realizations, which, in the case of natural images can be extremely realistic. In many image restoration problems, such as deblurring, colorization, inpainting, super-resolution, etc., probability densities are used as priors, one may therefore wonder whether we can, instead, adopt generative models. Indeed such methods have appeared in the literature, but they require exact knowledge of the transformations responsible for the data distortion and involve regularizer terms with weights that require adjustment. Our approach, by combining maximum a-posteriori probability with maximum likelihood estimation, can successfully restore images in both blind and non-blind modes without the need to fine-tune any regularization parameters. Simulations on deblurring, colorization, and image separation problems with exact knowledge of the transformation demonstrate improved image quality, reduced computational cost compared to existing methods. Comparable results are also enjoyed when the distortion models contain unknown parameters.},

Doing so involves learning a model of decision rewards conditional on individual-specific covariates. In many practical settings, these covariates are high dimensional; however, typically only a small subset of the observed features are predictive of a decision's success. We formulate this problem as a K-armed contextual bandit with high-dimensional covariates and present a new efficient bandit algorithm based on the LASSO estimator. We prove that our algorithm's cumulative expected regret scales at most polylogarithmically in the covariate dimension d; to the best of our knowledge, this is the first such bound for a contextual bandit. The key step in our analysis is proving a new tail inequality that guarantees the convergence of the LASSO estimator despite the non-i.i.d. data induced by the bandit policy. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical relevance of our algorithm by evaluating it on a simplified version of a medication dosing problem. A patient's optimal medication dosage depends on the patient's genetic profile and medical records; incorrect initial dosage may result in adverse consequences, such as stroke or bleeding. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing bandit methods and physicians in correctly dosing a majority of patients.},

A priori, it is unknown which species are present in each region and what are their corresponding frequencies. Species are shared among populations and each species can be present in more than one region with its frequency varying across populations. In this article, we consider the problem of sequentially sampling these populations to observe the greatest number of different species. We adopt a Bayesian nonparametric approach and endow (P1, \ldots, PJ) with a hierarchical Pitman\textendash Yor process prior. As a consequence of the hierarchical structure, the J unknown discrete probability measures share the same support, that of their common random base measure. Given this prior choice, we propose a sequential rule that, at every time step, given the information available up to that point, selects the population from which to collect the next observation. Rather than picking the population with the highest posterior estimate of producing a new value, the proposed rule includes a Thompson sampling step to better balance the exploration\textendash exploitation trade-off. We also propose an extension of the algorithm to deal with incidence data, where multiple observations are collected in a time period. The performance of the proposed algorithms is assessed through a simulation study and compared to three other strategies. Finally, we compare these algorithms using a dataset of species of trees, collected from different plots in South America. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

First, we overcome the restrictive (and often inadequate) assumptions of the Poisson model; next, we eliminate the need for the questionable base period by using a sequential procedure. We use empirical Bayes (EB) and Bayes methods and compare them with the traditional frequentist implementation. EB methods are somewhat easy to implement, and they deal nicely with extra-Poisson variability (and, at the same time, informally check the adequacy of the Poisson assumption). However. they still need the base period. The sequential, full Bayes approach, on the other hand, also avoids this drawback of traditional u-charts. The implementation requires numerical simulation, and also use of a prior distribution. Several possibilities for both objective and informative priors are explored. We argue that the sequential, full Bayesian uCC is a powerful and versatile tool for process monitoring.},

It is intended for undergraduates following courses in statistics but is also suitable preparatory read\- ing for some postgraduate courses. It is assumed that the reader has completed an introductory course which covered probability, random variables, moments and the sampling distributions. The level of mathematics required does not go beyond first year calculus. In case the reader has not acquired much facility in handling matrices, the results in least squares estimation are first obtained directly and then given an (optional) matrix formulation. If techniques for changing from one set of variables to another have not been met, then the appendix on these topics should be studied first. The same appendix contains essential discussion of the order statistics which are frequently used for illustrative purposes. Introductory courses usually include the elements of hypothesis testing and of point and interval estimation though the treatment must perforce become rather thin since at that stage it is difficult to provide adequate justifications for some procedures-plausible though they may seem. This text discusses these important topics in considerable detail, starting from scratch. The level is nowhere advanced and proofs of asymptotic results are omitted. Methods deriving from the Bayesian point of view are gradually introduced and alternate with the more usual techniques.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate \$t\$. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

  abstract = {This article examines US President Barack Obama's foreign policy rhetoric on Syria, specifically in relation to the threat of chemical weapons and the prohibitionary taboo surrounding their use. It contends that Obama's rhetorical construction of the taboo is not simply a commitment to the control of these horrific weapons (where such arms have been comprehended as so extensively vile as to preclude their employment), but that this also represents the strategic linguistic exploitation of these normative ideals in order to directly shape policy. By analysing of presidential speeches made during the conflict, it demonstrates that Obama has manipulated pre-existing conceptions of chemical weapons as taboo, and also as forms of weapons of mass destruction, to deliberately construct policy in line with his own political ambitions\textemdash most notably as a way of forcing a multilateral solution to the situation in Syria. This article challenges existing perceptions of the chemical weapons taboo as an inherently normative constraint, arguing that this instead comprises a more agency-driven construct. Static notions of the taboo must be abandoned and subsequently replaced with a framework of understanding that recognizes how the taboo can be used as a deliberate driver of foreign policy.},

There is, however, considerable value in considering integrated likelihood on its own, especially versions arising from default or noninformative priors.

Our results are motivated by recent applications of minimum Wasserstein estimators to complex generative models. We discuss some difficulties arising in the approximation of these estimators and illustrate their behavior in several numerical experiments.

Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has become a popular approach to overcome this issue, in which one simulates synthetic data sets given parameters and compares summaries of these data sets with the corresponding observed values. We propose to avoid the use of summaries and the ensuing loss of information by instead using the Wasserstein distance between the empirical distributions of the observed and synthetic data. This generalizes the well-known approach of using order statistics within ABC to arbitrary dimensions. We describe how recently developed approximations of the Wasserstein distance allow the method to scale to realistic data sizes, and propose a new distance based on the Hilbert space-filling curve. We provide a theoretical study of the proposed method, describing consistency as the threshold goes to zero while the observations are kept fixed, and concentration properties as the number of observations grows. Various extensions to time series data are discussed. The approach is illustrated on various examples, including univariate and multivariate g-and-k distributions, a toggle switch model from systems biology, a queueing model, and a L\textbackslash 'evy-driven stochastic volatility model.},

While this is appealing for some applications, this assumption is not appropriate for other tasks such as entity resolution (ER), modeling of sparse networks, and DNA sequencing tasks. Such applications require models that yield clusters whose sizes grow sublinearly with the total number of data points\textemdash the microclustering property. Motivated by these issues, we propose a general class of random partition models that satisfy the microclustering property with well-characterized theoretical properties. Our proposed models overcome major limitations in the existing literature on microclustering models, namely a lack of interpretability, identifiability, and full characterization of model asymptotic properties. Crucially, we drop the classical assumption of having an exchangeable sequence of data points, and instead assume an exchangeable sequence of clusters. In addition, our framework provides flexibility in terms of the prior distribution of cluster sizes, computational tractability, and applicability to a large number of microclustering tasks. We establish theoretical properties of the resulting class of priors, where we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the number of clusters and of the proportion of clusters of a given size. Our framework allows a simple and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to perform statistical inference. We illustrate our proposed methodology on the microclustering task of ER, where we provide a simulation study and real experiments on survey panel data.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the location of a single change point in a network generated by a dynamic stochastic block model mechanism. This model produces community structure in the network that exhibits change at a single time epoch. We propose two methods of estimating the change point, together with the model parameters, before and after its occurrence. The first employs a least-squares criterion function and takes into consideration the full structure of the stochastic block model and is evaluated at each point in time. Hence, as an intermediate step, it requires estimating the community structure based on a clustering algorithm at every time point. The second method comprises the following two steps: in the first one, a least-squares function is used and evaluated at each time point, but ignoring the community structure and only considering a random graph generating mechanism exhibiting a change point. Once the change point is identified, in the second step, all network data before and after it are used together with a clustering algorithm to obtain the corresponding community structures and subsequently estimate the generating stochastic block model parameters. The first method, since it requires knowledge of the community structure and hence clustering at every point in time, is significantly more computationally expensive than the second one. On the other hand, it requires a significantly less stringent identifiability condition for consistent estimation of the change point and the model parameters than the second method; however, it also requires a condition on the misclassification rate of misallocating network nodes to their respective communities that may fail to hold in many realistic settings. Despite the apparent stringency of the identifiability condition for the second method, we show that networks generated by a stochastic block mechanism exhibiting a change in their structure can easily satisfy this condition under a multitude of scenarios, including merging/splitting communities, nodes joining another community, etc. Further, for both methods under their respective identifiability and certain additional regularity conditions, we establish rates of convergence and derive the asymptotic distributions of the change point estimators. The results are illustrated on synthetic data. In summary, this work provides an in-depth investigation of the novel problem of change point analysis for networks generated by stochastic block models, identifies key conditions for the consistent estimation of the change point, and proposes a computationally fast algorithm that solves the problem in many settings that occur in applications. Finally, it discusses challenges posed by employing clustering algorithms in this problem, that require additional investigation for their full resolution.},

We propose a multiplicative gamma process shrinkage prior on the factor loadings which allows introduction of infinitely many factors, with the loadings increasingly shrunk towards zero as the column index increases. We use our prior on a parameter-expanded loading matrix to avoid the order dependence typical in factor analysis models and develop an efficient Gibbs sampler that scales well as data dimensionality increases. The gain in efficiency is achieved by the joint conjugacy property of the proposed prior, which allows block updating of the loadings matrix. We propose an adaptive Gibbs sampler for automatically truncating the infinite loading matrix through selection of the number of important factors. Theoretical results are provided on the support of the prior and truncation approximation bounds. A fast algorithm is proposed to produce approximate Bayes estimates. Latent factor regression methods are developed for prediction and variable selection in applications with high-dimensional correlated predictors.

I test an ensemble of regularization algorithms and find that there is room for substantial improvement on the multilevel model via more flexible methods of regularization. I propose a modified version of MRP that replaces the multilevel model with a nonparametric approach called Bayesian additive regression trees (BART or, when combined with post-stratification, BARP). I compare both methods across a number of data contexts, demonstrating the benefits of applying more powerful regularization methods to extrapolate opinion data to target geographical units. I provide an R package that implements the BARP method.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

This trend is due to increased emphasis on just-in-time techniques (JIT), synchronous manufacturing, job-shop settings, the reduction of in-process inventory, and costs. The term used to describe such low volume production is ``Short Runs Production'' or more commonly ``Short Runs.'' In such an environment, the run of a process is short, usually fewer than 50. Therefore, a principal practical problem is the need to chart a large number of different processes and the consequent large number of charts required. This article discusses proposed multivariate control charts for short runs based on individual measurements and subgrouped data.}

Self-starting methods attempt to address this issue adopting a hybrid scheme that executes calibration and monitoring simultaneously. In this work, we propose a Bayesian alternative that will utilize prior information and possible historical data (via power priors), offering a head-start in online monitoring, putting emphasis on outlier detection. For cases of complete prior ignorance, the objective Bayesian version will be provided. Charting will be based on the predictive distribution and the methodological framework will be derived in a general way, to facilitate discrete and continuous data from any distribution that belongs to the regular exponential family (with Normal, Poisson and Binomial being the most representative). Being in the Bayesian arena, we will be able to not only perform process monitoring, but also draw online inference regarding the unknown process parameter(s). An extended simulation study will evaluate the proposed methodology against frequentist based competitors and it will cover topics regarding prior sensitivity and model misspecification robustness. A continuous and a discrete real data set will illustrate its use in practice. Technical details, algorithms, guidelines on prior elicitation and R-codes are provided in appendices and supplementary material. Short production runs and online phase I monitoring are among the best candidates to benefit from the developed methodology.},

  abstract = {Some of the key mathematical results are stated without proof in order to make the underlying theory accessible to a wider audience. The book assumes a knowledge only of basic calculus, matrix algebra, and elementary statistics. The emphasis is on methods and the analysis of data sets. The logic and tools of model-building for stationary and nonstationary time series are developed in detail and numerous exercises, many of which make use of the included computer package, provide the reader with ample opportunity to develop skills in this area. The core of the book covers stationary processes, ARMA and ARIMA processes, multivariate time series and state-space models, with an optional chapter on spectral analysis. Additional topics include harmonic regression, the Burg and Hannan-Rissanen algorithms, unit roots, regression with ARMA errors, structural models, the EM algorithm, generalized state-space models with applications to time series of count data, exponential smoothing, the Holt-Winters and ARAR forecasting algorithms, transfer function models and intervention analysis. Brief introductions are also given to cointegration and to nonlinear, continuous-time and long-memory models. The time series package included in the back of the book is a slightly modified version of the package ITSM, published separately as ITSM for Windows, by Springer-Verlag, 1994. It does not handle such large data sets as ITSM for Windows, but like the latter, runs on IBM-PC compatible computers under either DOS or Windows (version 3.1 or later). The programs are all menu-driven so that the reader can immediately apply the techniques in the book to time series data, with a minimal investment of time in the computational and algorithmic aspects of the analysis.},

A draw from the beta process yields an infinite collection of probabilities in the unit interval, and a draw from the Bernoulli process turns these into binary-valued features. Recent work has provided stick-breaking representations for the beta process analogous to the well-known stick-breaking representation for the Dirichlet process. We derive one such stick-breaking representation directly from the characterization of the beta process as a completely random measure. This approach motivates a three-parameter generalization of the beta process, and we study the power laws that can be obtained from this generalized beta process. We present a posterior inference algorithm for the beta-Bernoulli process that exploits the stick-breaking representation, and we present experimental results for a discrete factor-analysis model.},

Furthermore, MCMC methods have enabled the development and use of intricate models in an astonishing array of disciplines as diverse as fisheries science and economics. The wide-ranging practical importance of MCMC has sparked an expansive and deep investigation into fundamental Markov chain theory.  The Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo provides a reference for the broad audience of developers and users of MCMC methodology interested in keeping up with cutting-edge theory and applications. The first half of the book covers MCMC foundations, methodology, and algorithms. The second half considers the use of MCMC in a variety of practical applications including in educational research, astrophysics, brain imaging, ecology, and sociology.  The in-depth introductory section of the book allows graduate students and practicing scientists new to MCMC to become thoroughly acquainted with the basic theory, algorithms, and applications. The book supplies detailed examples and case studies of realistic scientific problems presenting the diversity of methods used by the wide-ranging MCMC community. Those familiar with MCMC methods will find this book a useful refresher of current theory and recent developments.},

Priority has been placed on Australia, India, South Korea and south-east Asian countries, yet Japan's National Security Strategy also states that cooperation with Russia is crucial. This is controversial since the pursuit of closer ties continued despite Russia's intervention in Ukraine and since the policy sets Japan apart from its US ally. The purpose of this article is to explain the nature, motivations and prospects of this emerging security relationship. The article's key finding is that the Japanese security elite do not regard Russia as a significant threat since a clear differentiation is made between Russia's actions in eastern Europe and east Asia. Additionally, cooperation is considered vital to neutralize the danger of a prospective China\textendash Russia united front. These and related incentives have encouraged Japan to explore security cooperation with Russia, including via 2+2 meetings and search and rescue drills. However, due to a range of international and domestic constraints, Japan's security ties with Russia are likely to remain less developed than those with other partners in the region.},

We also pay special attention to non-Euclidean settings (relevant algorithms include Frank-Wolfe, mirror descent, and dual averaging) and discuss their relevance in machine learning. We provide a gentle introduction to structural optimization with FISTA (to optimize a sum of a smooth and a simple non-smooth term), saddle-point mirror prox (Nemirovski's alternative to Nesterov's smoothing), and a concise description of interior point methods. In stochastic optimization we discuss stochastic gradient descent, mini-batches, random coordinate descent, and sublinear algorithms. We also briefly touch upon convex relaxation of combinatorial problems and the use of randomness to round solutions, as well as random walks based methods.},

  abstract = {We discuss a model-robust theory for general types of regression in the simplest case of iid observations. The theory replaces the parameters of parametric models with statistical functionals, to be called ``regression functionals'' and defined on large non-parametric classes of joint x-y distributions without assuming a working model. Examples of regression functionals are the slopes of OLS linear equations at largely arbitrary x-y distributions (see Part I). More generally, regression functionals can be defined by minimizing objective functions or solving estimating equations at joint x-y distributions. The role of parametric models is reduced to heuristics for generating objective functions and estimating equations without assuming them as correct. In this framework it is possible to achieve the following: (1) explicate the meaning of mis/well-specification for regression functionals, (2) decompose sampling variability into two components, one due to the conditional response distributions and another due to the regressor distribution interacting (conspiring) with misspecification, (3) exhibit plug-in (and hence sandwich) estimators of standard error as limiting cases of x-y bootstrap estimators.

This estimator is known to be "heteroskedasticity-consistent", but it is less well-known to be "nonlinearity-consistent'' as well. Nonlinearity, however, raises fundamental issues because in its presence regressors are not ancillary, hence can't be treated as fixed. The consequences are deep: (1)\textasciitilde population slopes need to be re-interpreted as statistical functionals obtained from OLS fits to largely arbitrary joint \$\textbackslash xy\$\textasciitilde distributions; (2)\textasciitilde the meaning of slope parameters needs to be rethought; (3)\textasciitilde the regressor distribution affects the slope parameters; (4)\textasciitilde randomness of the regressors becomes a source of sampling variability in slope estimates; (5)\textasciitilde inference needs to be based on model-robust standard errors, including sandwich estimators or the \$\textbackslash xy\$\textasciitilde bootstrap. In theory, model-robust and model-trusting standard errors can deviate by arbitrary magnitudes either way. In practice, significant deviations between them can be detected with a diagnostic test.},

  abstract = {Comparing probability distributions is an indispensable and ubiquitous task in machine learning and statistics. The most common way to compare a pair of Borel probability measures is to compute a metric between them, and by far the most widely used notions of metric are the Wasserstein metric and the total variation metric. The next most common way is to compute a divergence between them, and in this case almost every known divergences such as those of Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, R\textbackslash 'enyi, and many more, are special cases of the \$f\$-divergence. Nevertheless these metrics and divergences may only be computed, in fact, are only defined, when the pair of probability measures are on spaces of the same dimension. How would one measure, say, a Wasserstein distance between the uniform distribution on the interval \$[-1,1]\$ and a Gaussian distribution on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^3\$? We will show that various common notions of metrics and divergences can be extended in a completely natural manner to Borel probability measures defined on spaces of different dimensions, e.g., one on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^m\$ and another on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^n\$ where \$m, n\$ are distinct, so as to give a meaningful answer to the previous question.},

A common strategy is to use a mixture of Poissons, which unfortunately is quite restrictive in not accounting for distributions having variance less than the mean. Other approaches include mixing multinomials, which requires finite support, and using a Dirichlet process prior with a Poisson base measure, which does not allow smooth deviations from the Poisson. As a broad class of alternative models, we propose to use nonparametric mixtures of rounded continuous kernels. An efficient Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior computation, and a simulation study is performed to assess performance. Focusing on the rounded Gaussian case, we generalize the modeling framework to account for multivariate count data, joint modeling with continuous and categorical variables, and other complications. The methods are illustrated through applications to a developmental toxicity study and marketing data. This article has .},

At each level in an infinitely-deep binary tree, we place a beta dictionary density; within a scale the densities are equivalent to Bernstein polynomials. Using a stick-breaking characterization, stochastically decreasing weights are allocated to the finer scale dictionary elements. A slice sampler is used for posterior computation, and properties are described. The method characterizes densities with locally-varying smoothness, and can produce a sequence of coarse to fine density estimates.

Natural generalization of the popular class of Dirichlet process mixture models, they allow for more robust inference on the number of components characterizing the distribution of the data. We propose a new sampling strategy for such models, named importance conditional sampling (ICS), which combines appealing properties of existing methods, including easy interpretability and straightforward quantification of posterior uncertainty. An extensive simulation study highlights the efficiency of the proposed method which, unlike other conditional samplers, is robust to the specification of the parameters characterizing the Pitman-Yor process. The ICS also proves more efficient than the marginal sampler, as soon as the sample size is not small, and, importantly, the step to update latent parameters is fully parallelizable. We further show that the ICS approach can be naturally extended to other classes of computationally demanding models, such as nonparametric mixture models for partially exchangeable data. The behaviour of our method is illustrated by analysing a rich dataset from the Collaborative Perinatal Project.},

  abstract = {Many contemporary large-scale applications involve building interpretable models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a nonlinear fashion, such as when the response is binary. Although this modeling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to effectively control the fraction of false discoveries even in high-dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general high-dimensional nonlinear models. To address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of \$model\$-\$X\$ knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure (Barber and Cand\textbackslash `es, 2015) originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with \$n\textbackslash ge p\$, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires the covariates be random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown/estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no other procedure solves the \$controlled\$ variable selection problem in such generality, but in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we apply our procedure to data from a case-control study of Crohn's disease in the United Kingdom, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of the same data.},

In this paper, we consider a scenario in which the arms\&\#39; reward distributions may change in a piecewise-stationary fashion at unknown time steps. By connecting change-detection techniques with classic UCB algorithms, we motivate and propose a learning algorithm called M-UCB, which can detect and adapt to changes, for the considered scenario.

Comparison with the best available lower bound shows that M-UCB is nearly optimal in \$T\$ up to a logarithmic factor. We also compare M-UCB with state-of-the-art algorithms in a numerical experiment based on a public Yahoo! dataset. In this experiment, M-UCB achieves about \$50 \textbackslash\%\$ regret reduction with respect to the best performing state-of-the-art algorithm.},

The block-reordering scheme reorders between and within the diagonal blocks to reduce the impact of integration variables from right to left, thus improving the Monte Carlo convergence rate. Simulations up to dimension 65,536 suggest that the new method can improve the run time by an order of magnitude compared with the hierarchical quasi-Monte Carlo method and two orders of magnitude compared with the dense quasi-Monte Carlo method. Our method also forms a strong substitute for the approximate conditioning methods as a more robust estimation with error guarantees.

A widely-implemented solution is to express the probability parameter via a probit mapping of a Gaussian process indexed by predictors. However, unlike for continuous settings, there is a lack of closed-form results for predictive distributions in binary models with Gaussian process priors. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and approximation strategies provide common solutions to this problem, but state-of-the-art algorithms are either computationally intractable or inaccurate in moderate-to-high dimensions. In this article, we aim to cover this gap by deriving closed-form expressions for the predictive probabilities in probit Gaussian processes that rely either on cumulative distribution functions of multivariate Gaussians or on functionals of multivariate truncated normals. To evaluate these quantities we develop novel scalable solutions based on tile-low-rank Monte Carlo methods for computing multivariate Gaussian probabilities, and on mean-field variational approximations of multivariate truncated normals. Closed-form expressions for the marginal likelihood and for the posterior distribution of the Gaussian process are also discussed. As shown in simulated and real-world empirical studies, the proposed methods scale to dimensions where state-of-the-art solutions are impractical.},

Since the mean of the observations after the change is unknown, detection algorithms based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, GLR, and on window-limited type GLR, are considered. As Lai (1995) pointed out, it is very difficult to find a satisfactory choice of both window size and threshold for these change detection algorithms. The basic idea of this article is to estimate, through the stochastic approximation of Robbins and Monro, the threshold value which satisfies a constraint on the mean between false alarms, for a specified window size. A convenient stopping rule, based on the first passage time of an F-statistic below a fixed boundary, is used to terminate the iterative approximation. Then, the window size which produces the most desirable out-of-control ARL, for a fixed value of the in-control ARL, can be selected. These change detection algorithms are applied to detect biases on the measurements of ozone, recorded from one monitoring site of Bologna (Italy). Comparisons of the ARL profiles reveal that the full-GLR scheme provides much more protection than the window-limited GLR schemes against small shifts in the process, but the modified window-limited GLR provides more protection against large shifts.

In particular, in the case of an autocorrelated process, the GLR test uses the information contained in the time-varying response after a change and, as shown by Apley and Shi, is able to outperfom traditional control charts applied to residuals. In addition, a GLR chart provides estimates of the magnitude and the time of occurrence of the change. In this article we present a practical approach to implementating GLR charts for monitoring an autoregressive moving average process assuming that only a phase I sample is available. The proposed approach, based on automatic time series identification, estimates the GLR control limits through stochastic approximation using bootstrap resampling and thus is able to take into account the uncertainty about the underlying model. A Monte Carlo study shows that our methodology can be used to design, in a semiautomatic fashion, a GLR chart with a prescribed rate of false alarms when as few as 50 phase I observations are available.

  abstract = {One approach to monitoring autocorrelated data consists in applying a control chart to the residuals of a time series model estimated from process observations. Recent research shows that the impact of estimation error on the run length properties of the resulting charts is not negligible. In this paper a general strategy for implementing residual-based control schemes is investigated. The designing procedure uses the AR-sieve approximation assuming that the process allows an autoregressive representation of order infinity. The run length distribution is estimated using bootstrap resampling in order to account for uncertainty in the estimated parameters. Control limits that satisfy a given constraint on the false alarm rate are computed via stochastic approximation. The proposed procedure is investigated for three residual-based control charts: generalized likelihood ratio, cumulative sum and exponentially weighted moving average. Results show that the bootstrap approach safeguards against an undesirably high rate of false alarms. In addition, the out-of-control bootstrap chart sensitivity seems to be comparable to that of charts designed under the assumption that the estimated model is equal to the true generating process.

Self-starting charts can be applied to these low-volume applications. In this article, two new self-starting multivariate control charts, both based on a CUSCORE-type procedure, are proposed for monitoring the unknown mean of a multivariate normal distribution. These charting procedures, which weight current observations according to the information contained in the fault signature, are able to outperform the previously suggested self-starting charts, which neglect the dynamic pattern of the mean change.},

A statistical process control procedure would have superior efficiency when limited to the subset of variables likely responsible for the out-of-control conditions. The key idea of this article consists of combining a variable selection method with a multivariate control chart to detect changes in both the mean and variability of a multidimensional process with Gaussian errors. In particular, we develop a control chart for Phase II monitoring which integrates the least angle regression algorithm with a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average. Comparisons with related multivariate control schemes demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed control chart in a wide range of practical applications, including profile and multistage process monitoring. Further, the proposed scheme may also provide valuable diagnostic information for fault isolation. Supplemental materials, including an R package, are available online.},

Most Phase I control charts are based on the assumption of normally distributed observations. However, distribution-free methods appear to be ideal candidates for Phase I applications. Indeed, because little information is available, it is difficult to validate a distributional assumption in Phase I or at least at its beginning stage. In addition, as has been noted in the literature, this assumption cannot be checked before process stability is established. In this article, we propose a new distribution-free Phase I procedure for univariate observations. The suggested method, based on recursive segmentation and permutation, detects single or multiple mean and/or scale shifts. A simulation study shows that our method compares favorably with parametric control charts when the process is normally distributed and performs better than other nonparametric control charts when the process distribution is skewed or heavy tailed.

In recent years, control charts based on variable selection (VS) algorithms have been suggested for monitoring multivariate data. These charts share the common idea that process faults usually affect a small fraction of the monitored quality characteristics. Thus, VS methods can be used to identify the subset of the variables for which the shift may have occurred. However, the suggested VS-based control charts differ in many aspects such as the particular VS algorithm and the type of control statistic.

  abstract = {The accurate determination of control limits is crucial in statistical process control. The usual approach consists in computing the limits so that the in-control run-length distribution has some desired properties; for example, a prescribed mean. However, as a consequence of the increasing complexity of process data, the run-length of many control charts discussed in the recent literature can be studied only through simulation. Furthermore, in some scenarios, such as profile and autocorrelated data monitoring, the limits cannot be tabulated in advance, and when different charts are combined, the control limits depend on a multidimensional vector of parameters. In this article, we propose the use of stochastic approximation methods for control chart calibration and discuss enhancements for their implementation (e.g., the initialization of the algorithm, an adaptive choice of the gain, a suitable stopping rule for the iterative process, and the advantages of using multicore workstations). Examples are used to show that simulated stochastic approximation provides a reliable and fully automatic approach for computing the control limits in complex applications.

  abstract = {Starting the online monitoring of a quality characteristic by means of a control chart at the beginning of a short production run is often a challenging issue for quality practitioners: in fact, the frequent absence of preliminary information prevents from getting a precise estimate of the characteristic mean and standard deviation. Furthermore, for short runs having a finite rolling horizon, the number of inspections scheduled within the run can be too small to get sufficient samples allowing the phase~I implementation of the chart to be completed. Recently, t control charts have been proposed as efficient means to overcome this problem because they do not need any phase~I tentative control limits definition or preliminary process knowledge. In this paper, a variable sample size (VSS) version of the t~chart is proposed. Adaptive control charts have been implemented with success in long runs: here, the performance of the variable sample size strategy is investigated for a chart used in a short run. The statistical performance of the VSS t~chart is compared with the one of the fixed-parameter (FP) t~chart for both scenarios of fixed and unknown shift size, with the latter situation being frequent in short-run manufacturing environments. An extensive numerical investigation reveals the potential benefits of the proposed chart. When the statistical design is optimized with respect to a fixed value of the shift size {$\delta$}, the VSS t~chart has a better statistical performance than the FP t~chart for moderate to large values of {$\delta$}. Conversely, for the unknown shift size condition, the VSS t~chart always outperforms the FP t~chart for in-control average sample sizes ASS0\,{$>$}\,7. An illustrative example shows the implementation of the VSS during the production of a finite lot of mechanical parts.},

Given a reference model previously built including all variables present in the data, projection predictive inference projects its posterior onto a constrained space of a subset of variables. Variable selection is then performed by sequentially adding relevant variables until predictive performance is satisfactory. Previously, projection predictive inference has been demonstrated only for generalized linear models (GLMs) and Gaussian processes (GPs) where it showed superior performance to competing variable selection procedures. In this work, we extend projection predictive inference to support variable and structure selection for generalized linear multilevel models (GLMMs) and generalized additive multilevel models (GAMMs). Our simulative and real-word experiments demonstrate that our method can drastically reduce the model complexity required to reach reference predictive performance and achieve good frequency properties.},

  abstract = {Community detection on networks is a well-known problem encountered in many fields, for which the existing algorithms are inefficient 1) at capturing overlaps in-between communities, 2) at detecting communities having disparities in size and density 3) at taking into account the networks' dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm (iLCD) for community detection using a radically new approach. Taking into account the dynamics of the network, it is designed for the detection of strongly overlapping communities. We first explain the main principles underlying the iLCD algorithm, introducing the two notions of intrinsic communities and longitudinal detection, and detail the algorithm. Then, we illustrate its efficiency in the case of a citation network, and then compare it with existing most efficient algorithms using a standard generator of community-based networks, the LFR benchmark.},

  abstract = {The modern development of data acquisition technologies in many industrial processes is facilitating the collection of quality characteristics that are apt to be modeled as functions, which are usually referred to as profiles. At the same time, measurements of concurrent variables, which are related to the quality characteristic profiles, are often available in a functional form as well, and usually referred to as covariates. To adjust the monitoring of the quality characteristic profiles by the effect of this additional information, a new functional control chart is elaborated on the residuals obtained from a function-on-function linear regression of the quality characteristic profile on the functional covariates. By means of a Monte Carlo simulation study, the proposed control chart is compared with other control charts already appeared in the literature and some remarks are given on its use in presence of covariate mean shifts. Furthermore, a real-case study in the shipping industry is presented with the purpose of monitoring ship fuel consumption and thus, CO2 emissions from a Ro-Pax ship, with particular regard to detecting their reduction after a specific energy efficiency initiative.},

Such spatiotemporal data has immense value for increasing situational awareness of local events, providing insights for investigations and understanding the extent of incidents, their severity, and consequences, as well as their time-evolving nature. In analyzing social media data, researchers have mainly focused on finding temporal trends according to volume-based importance. Hence, a relatively small volume of relevant messages may easily be obscured by a huge data set indicating normal situations. In this paper, we present a visual analytics approach that provides users with scalable and interactive social media data analysis and visualization including the exploration and examination of abnormal topics and events within various social media data sources, such as Twitter, Flickr and YouTube. In order to find and understand abnormal events, the analyst can first extract major topics from a set of selected messages and rank them probabilistically using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. He can then apply seasonal trend decomposition together with traditional control chart methods to find unusual peaks and outliers within topic time series. Our case studies show that situational awareness can be improved by incorporating the anomaly and trend examination techniques into a highly interactive visual analysis process.},

There are many applications where there is insufficient information to justify such assumption(s) and, consequently, control charting techniques with a minimal set of distributional assumption requirements are in high demand. To this end, nonparametric or distribution-free control charts have been proposed in recent years. The charts have stable in-control properties, are robust against outliers and can be surprisingly efficient in comparison with their parametric counterparts. Chakraborti and some of his colleagues provided review papers on nonparametric control charts in 2001, 2007 and 2011, respectively. These papers have been received with considerable interest and attention by the community. However, the literature on nonparametric statistical process/quality control/monitoring has grown exponentially and because of this rapid growth, an update is deemed necessary. In this article, we bring these reviews forward to 2017, discussing some of the latest developments in the area. Moreover, unlike the past reviews, which did not include the multivariate charts, here we review both univariate and multivariate nonparametric control charts. We end with some concluding remarks.},

The t control chart proposed recently can overcome this problem. The EWMA t control chart has been proposed to monitor the process mean, but a single EWMA t control chart cannot perform well for small and large shifts simultaneously, which is known as the ``inertia problem''. The adaptive varying smoothing parameter EWMA (AEWMA) control chart can overcome the inertia problem. In this paper, the AEWMA t control chart for short run process is proposed. The truncated average run length and the probability of trigger a signal are adopted to test the performance of short run AEWMA t chart. Based on the investigation of the joint effect of control chart parameters on the performance of AEWMA t chart, a new optimization algorithm is proposed for statistical design of the AEWMA control chart. Simulations are performed for perfect and imperfect setup conditions, the results show that the AEWMA t control chart performs better than the EWMA t control chart.},

Existing process control techniques typically require substantial knowledge about the in-control and out-of-control distributions of the process, which is often difficult to obtain in practice. We propose (a) using a sequence of control limits for the cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts, where the control limits are determined by the conditional distribution of the CUSUM statistic given the last time it was zero, and (b) estimating the control limits by bootstrap. Traditionally, the CUSUM control chart uses a single control limit, which is obtained under the assumption that the in-control and out-of-control distributions of the process are Normal. When the normality assumption is not valid, which is often true in applications, the actual in-control average run length, defined to be the expected time duration before the control chart signals a process change, is quite different from the nominal in-control average run length. This limitation is mostly eliminated in the proposed procedure, which is distribution-free and robust against different choices of the in-control and out-of-control distributions.},

In each round, a super arm is played and the outcomes of its related simple arms are observed, which helps the selection of super arms in future rounds. The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of played arms, and it only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an ({$\alpha$},{$\beta$})-approximation oracle that takes the  means of the distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability {$\beta$}generates  an {$\alpha$}fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of a CMAB algorithm is to minimize \textbackslash em ({$\alpha$},{$\beta$})-approximation regret, which is the difference in total expected reward between the {$\alpha\beta$}fraction of expected reward when always playing the optimal super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(\textbackslash log n) regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound for classical MAB problem up to a constant factor, and it significantly improves the regret bound in a recent paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, probabilistic maximum coverage (PMC) for online advertising and social influence maximization for viral marketing, both having nonlinear reward structures.},

This methodology yields the following benefits and problem solutions: (a )It provides guidance in tailoring stress functions to a given data situation, responding to the fact that no single stress function dominates all others across all data situations; (b) the methodology enriches the supply of available stress functions; (c) it helps our understanding of stress functions by replacing the comparison of discrete proposals with a characterization of the effect of parameters on embeddings; (d) it builds a bridge to graph drawing, which is the related but not identical art of constructing embeddings from graphs.},

  abstract = {Our proposed technique, referred to as cluster-based profile monitoring, incorporates a cluster-analysis phase to aid in determining the possible existence of profiles in the historical data set resulting from an out-of-control process. The proposed method first replaces the data from each sampled unit with an estimated profile, using some appropriate regression method, and clusters the profiles based on their estimated parameter vectors. This yields an initial main cluster, which contains at least half the profiles. The initial estimated parameters for the population average (PA) profile are obtained by fitting a linear mixed model to those profiles in the main cluster. Profiles that are not contained in the initial main cluster may be iteratively added to the main cluster and the mixed model used to update the estimated parameters for the PA profile. Those profiles contained in the final main cluster are considered as resulting from the in-control process while those not included are considered as resulting from an out-of-control process. A simulated example, a Monte Carlo study, and an application demonstrate the performance advantages of this proposed method over a non-cluster based method with respect to more accurate estimates of the PA parameters and improved classification performance criteria.When the profiles can be represented by m {$\rho$} \texttimes{} 1 vectors, the profile monitoring process is equivalent to the detection of multivariate outliers. For this reason, we also compare our proposed method to a popular method used to identify outliers when dealing with a multivariate response. Our study demonstrates that, when the out-of-control process corresponds to a sustained shift, the cluster-based method using the successive difference estimator is clearly the superior method, among those methods we considered, based on all performance criteria.},

  abstract = {Monitoring multivariate quality variables or data streams remains an important and challenging problem in statistical process control (SPC). Although the multivariate SPC has been extensively studied in the literature, designing distribution-free control schemes are still challenging and yet to be addressed well. This article develops a new nonparametric methodology for monitoring location parameters when only a small reference dataset is available. The key idea is to construct a series of conditionally distribution-free test statistics in the sense that their distributions are free of the underlying distribution given the empirical distribution functions. The conditional probability that the charting statistic exceeds the control limit at present given that there is no alarm before the current time point can be guaranteed to attain a specified false alarm rate. The success of the proposed method lies in the use of data-dependent control limits, which are determined based on the observations online rather than decided before monitoring. Our theoretical and numerical studies show that the proposed control chart is able to deliver satisfactory in-control run-length performance for any distributions with any dimension. It is also very efficient in detecting multivariate process shifts when the process distribution is heavy-tailed or skewed. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Entity resolution identifies and removes duplicate entities in large, noisy databases and has grown in both usage and new developments as a result of increased data availability. Nevertheless, entity resolution has tradeoffs regarding assumptions of the data generation process, error rates, and computational scalability that make it a difficult task for real applications. In this paper, we focus on a related problem of unique entity estimation, which is the task of estimating the unique number of entities and associated standard errors in a data set with duplicate entities. Unique entity estimation shares many fundamental challenges of entity resolution, namely, that the computational cost of all-to-all entity comparisons is intractable for large databases. To circumvent this computational barrier, we propose an efficient (near-linear time) estimation algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing. Our estimator, under realistic assumptions, is unbiased and has provably low variance compared to existing random sampling based approaches. In addition, we empirically show its superiority over the state-of-the-art estimators on three real applications. The motivation for our work is to derive an accurate estimate of the documented, identifiable deaths in the ongoing Syrian conflict. Our methodology, when applied to the Syrian data set, provides an estimate of \$191,874 \textbackslash pm 1772\$ documented, identifiable deaths, which is very close to the Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) estimate of 191,369. Our work provides an example of challenges and efforts involved in solving a real, noisy challenging problem where modeling assumptions may not hold.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the stochastic combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework that allows a general nonlinear reward function, whose expected value may not depend only on the means of the input random variables but possibly on the entire distributions of these variables. Our framework enables a much larger class of reward functions such as the \$\textbackslash max()\$ function and nonlinear utility functions. Existing techniques relying on accurate estimations of the means of random variables, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) technique, do not work directly on these functions. We propose a new algorithm called stochastically dominant confidence bound (SDCB), which estimates the distributions of underlying random variables and their stochastically dominant confidence bounds. We prove that SDCB can achieve \$O(\textbackslash log\{T\})\$ distribution-dependent regret and \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(\textbackslash sqrt\{T\})\$ distribution-independent regret, where \$T\$ is the time horizon. We apply our results to the \$K\$-MAX problem and expected utility maximization problems. In particular, for \$K\$-MAX, we provide the first polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for its offline problem, and give the first \$\textbackslash tilde\{O\}(\textbackslash sqrt T)\$ bound on the \$(1-\textbackslash epsilon)\$-approximation regret of its online problem, for any \$\textbackslash epsilon{$>$}0\$.},

Both express support for the first two pillars of R2P while resisting coercive intervention under its aegis, as they share anxieties of domestic political security and concerns about their international image. Nonetheless, addressing cases like the Syrian crisis, Russian statements are more assertive and even aggressive while Chinese ones are usually vague and reactive. This article highlights the two states' different tones through computer-assisted text analyses. It argues that diplomatic styles reflect Russian and Chinese perceptions of their own place in the evolving international order. Experiences in past decades create divergent reference points and status prospects for them, which leads to their different strategies in signalling Great Power status. As Beijing is optimistic about its status-rising prospects, it exercises more self-restraint in order to avoid external containments and is reluctant to act as an independent `spoiler'. Meanwhile, Moscow interprets its Great Power status more from a frame of `loss' and therefore is inclined to adopt a sterner approach to signal its status. Although their policies complement each other on many occasions, there is nothing akin to a Sino\textendash Russian `bloc'.},

Various consistent selection methods, including the use of Schwarz information criterion and cross-validation, have been proposed to balance the model fitting and complexity. However, there is lack of systematic approaches to provide theoretical guarantee of significance in determining the number of changes. In this paper, we introduce a data-adaptive selection procedure via error rate control based on order-preserving sample-splitting, which is applicable to most existing change-point methods. The key idea is to construct a series of statistics with global symmetry property and then utilize the symmetry to derive a data-driven threshold. Under this general framework, we are able to rigorously investigate the false discovery proportion control, and show that the proposed method controls the false discovery rate (FDR) asymptotically under mild conditions while retaining the true change-points. Numerical experiments indicate that our selection procedure works well for many change-detection methods and is able to yield accurate FDR control in finite samples.

To be robust to the process distribution, the spatial sign statistic that defines the multivariate direction of an observation is used to construct a Shewhart-type control chart for detecting out-of-control observations in historical phase I data. The proposed control chart is distribution free in the sense that the false-positive rate (or false alarm rate), the proportion of wrongly classified in-control samples, can be controlled at the specified value for elliptical-direction distributions. In addition, we demonstrate through simulation studies that the false-positive rate of the proposed chart is robust to the shift size of the out-of-control condition if we only delete the most extreme out-of-control observation at each iteration of phase I analysis. Compared with the traditional Hotelling's T2 control chart and some of its robust versions, the proposed chart is generally more powerful in detecting out-of-control observations and more robust to the normality assumption.

Motivated by ensemble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in particular, BART is defined by a statistical model: a prior and a likelihood. This approach enables full posterior inference including point and interval estimates of the unknown regression function as well as the marginal effects of potential predictors. By keeping track of predictor inclusion frequencies, BART can also be used for model-free variable selection. BART's many features are illustrated with a bake-off against competing methods on 42 different data sets, with a simulation experiment and on a drug discovery classification problem.},

These methods have become a staple for the sequential analysis of data in such diverse fields as signal processing, epidemiology, machine learning, population ecology, quantitative finance, and robotics.The coverage is comprehensive, ranging from the underlying theory to computational implementation, methodology, and diverse applications in various areas of science. This is achieved by describing SMC algorithms as particular cases of a general framework, which involves concepts such as Feynman-Kac distributions, and tools such as importance sampling and resampling. This general framework is used consistently throughout the book.Extensive coverage is provided on sequential learning (filtering, smoothing) of state-space (hidden Markov) models, as this remains an important application of SMC methods. More recent applications, such as parameter estimation of these models (through e.g. particle Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques) and the simulation of challenging probability distributions (in e.g. Bayesian inference or rare-event problems), are also discussed.The book may be used either as a graduate text on Sequential Monte Carlo methods and state-space modeling, or as a general reference work on the area. Each chapter includes a set of exercises for self-study, a comprehensive bibliography, and a ``Python corner,'' which discusses the practical implementation of the methods covered.

However, difficulties finding, or approximating, the null distribution of the statistics may have contributed to the lack of popularity of these methods. In this paper, we propose transforming the sequential ranks into sequential normal scores which are independent, and asymptotically standard normal random variables. Thus original methods based on the normality assumption may be used. A novel approach permits the inclusion of a priori information in the form of quantiles. It is developed as a strategy to increase the sensitivity of the scoring statistic. The result is a powerful convenient method to analyze non-normal data sequences. Also, four variations of sequential normal scores are presented using examples from the literature. Researchers and practitioners might find this approach useful to develop nonparametric procedures to address new problems extending the use of parametric procedures when distributional assumptions are not met. These methods are especially useful with large data streams where efficient computational methods are required.},

  abstract = {Statistical methods for analyzing economic data need to be timely, accurate and easy to compute. To accomplish this, parametric models are often assumed, but they are at best approximate, and often lack a good fit in the tails of the distribution where much of the interesting data are concentrated. Therefore, nonparametric methods have been extensively examined as alternatives to the constrictive assumptions of parametric models. This paper examines the use of Sequential Normal Scores (SNS) for transforming time series data with unknown distributions into time series data that are approximately standard-normally distributed. Particular attention is directed toward detecting outliers (out-of-control values), and applying subsequent analytic methods such as CUSUMs and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) schemes. Two examples of stock market data are presented for illustration.},

  abstract = {The recently adopted Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) has caused much debate and controversy in global nuclear politics. Given that the stated goal of the TPNW supporters (states and NGOs alike) is to embed the treaty in the structures of nuclear governance and to strengthen its normative power, how likely is the TPNW to achieve these objectives? The article argues that the unique structures of legitimacy and value within which nuclear weapons are enmeshed place particular complications on the normative force of the TPNW as compared to previous humanitarian arms control initiatives, which has implications for the way in which the TPNW can function to consolidate a prohibitionary norm on nuclear weapons possession. The article uses the framing of legitimacy to analyse the complex structures within which the TPNW was adopted and within which it will enter into force, particularly focusing on the TPNW's relationship to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The article concludes that consolidation may require a further challenge to the existing structures of nuclear order than state actors have, so far, been willing to make. This work is based on first-hand observations from the TPNW negotiations and interviews with civil society actors at the United Nations in New York in June and July 2017.},

Introduction to Algorithms uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, substantial additions to the chapter on recurrence (now called ``Divide-and-Conquer''), and an appendix on matrices. It features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many exercises and problems have been added for this edition. The international paperback edition is no longer available; the hardcover is available worldwide.},

In many manufacturing environments, such as the nuclear weapons complex, emphasis has shifted from the regular production and delivery of large orders to infrequent small orders. However, the challenge to maintain the same high quality and reliability standards while building much smaller lot sizes remains. To meet this challenge, specific areas need more attention, including fast and on-target process start-up, low volume statistical process control, process characterization with small experiments, and estimating reliability given few actual performance tests of the product. In this paper we address the issue of low volume statistical process control. We investigate an adaptive filtering approach to process monitoring with a relatively short time series of autocorrelated data. The emphasis is on estimation and minimization of mean squared error rather than the traditional hypothesis testing and run length analyses associated with process control charting. We develop an adaptive filtering technique that assumes initial process parameters are unknown, and updates the parameters as more data become available. Using simulation techniques, we study the data requirements (the length of a time series of autocorrelated data) necessary to adequately estimate process parameters. We show that far fewer data values are needed than is typically recommended for process control applications. We also demonstrate the techniques with a case study from the nuclear weapons manufacturing complex.}

There is currently a shift of paradigm in the algebraic foundations of these fields. Quite recently, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to outperform SVD at a number of tasks. Increasing research efforts are spent on the study and application of decompositions of higher-order tensors or multi-way arrays. This paper is a partial survey on tensor generalizations of the SVD and their applications. We also touch on nonnegative tensor factorizations.},

Recently, Q charts have been proposed to address this problem. We study the average run length (ARL) of Q charts for a normally distributed variable assuming that a sustained shift occurs in the quality characteristic. It is shown that in some cases Q charts do not exhibit adequate ARL performance. Modifications that enhance the ARL properties of Q charts are presented. Some alternatives to Q charts are also discussed. For the case of a known process target two alternative methods are presented: an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) method and an adaptive Kalman filtering method. It is shown that both methods have better ARL performance than Q charts for that case. For the case of both process parameters unknown, an adaptive Kalman filtering method used with a tracking signal provides an ARL performance that improves as better estimates of the process mean and variance are given. A practical example illustrates the tracking signal method for the case when the process parameters are unknown.},

Recently, extending the notion of data depth to the functional setting attracted a lot of attention among theoretical and applied statisticians. We go further and suggest a notion of data depth suitable for data represented as curves, or trajectories, which is independent of the parameterization. We show that our curve depth satisfies theoretical requirements of general depth functions that are meaningful for trajectories. We apply our methodology to diffusion tensor brain images and also to pattern recognition of handwritten digits and letters. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In each case, the proposed new measure has a direct interpretation in terms of the effects on a parameter of interest, and collapses to the familiar linear regression measure when there are no random effects. The new measures are explicitly defined functions and do not necessitate re-estimation of the model, especially for cluster deletion diagnostics. The basis for both the cluster deletion diagnostics and Cook's distance is a generalization of Miller's simple update formula for case deletion for linear models. Pregibon's infinitesimal case deletion diagnostics is adapted to the linear mixed-effects model. A simple compact matrix formula is derived to assess the local influence of the fixed-effects regression coefficients. Finally, a link between the local influence approach and Cook's distance is established. These influence measures are applied to an analysis of 5-year Medicare reimbursements to colon cancer patients to identify the most influential observations and their effects on the fixed-effects coefficients.

We study a consideration for the exploration vs. exploitation framework that does not arise in multi-armed bandits but is crucial in contextual bandits; the way exploration and exploitation is conducted in the present affects the bias and variance in the potential outcome model estimation in subsequent stages of learning. We develop parametric and non-parametric contextual bandits that integrate balancing methods from the causal inference literature in their estimation to make it less prone to problems of estimation bias. We provide the first regret bound analyses for contextual bandits with balancing in the domain of linear contextual bandits that match the state of the art regret bounds. We demonstrate the strong practical advantage of balanced contextual bandits on a large number of supervised learning datasets and on a synthetic example that simulates model mis-specification and prejudice in the initial training data. Additionally, we develop contextual bandits with simpler assignment policies by leveraging sparse model estimation methods from the econometrics literature and demonstrate empirically that in the early stages they can improve the rate of learning and decrease regret.},

Our technique is based on a marginalised chain on the knot number and locations, but we provide methods for inference about the regression coefficients, and functions of them, in both normal and nonnormal models.

While many new general purpose machine learning approaches have emerged, they remain poorly understand and irreconcilable with more traditional statistical modeling approaches. We present a general class of exponential smoothed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are well suited to modeling nonstationary dynamical systems arising in industrial applications. In particular, we analyze their capacity to characterize the nonlinear partial autocorrelation structure of time series and directly capture dynamic effects such as seasonality and trends. Application of exponentially smoothed RNNs to forecasting electricity load, weather data, and stock prices highlight the efficacy of exponential smoothing of the hidden state for multistep time series forecasting. The results also suggest that popular, but more complicated neural network architectures originally designed for speech processing are likely over-engineered for industrial forecasting and light-weight exponentially smoothed architectures, trained in a fraction of the time, capture the salient features while being superior and more robust than simple RNNs and autoregressive models. Additionally, uncertainty quantification of Bayesian exponential smoothed RNNs is shown to provide improved coverage.},

Traditionally, an estimated in-control occurrence rate from a Phase I dataset is used to calculate the control limits when the rate is unknown. However, when Phase I analysis is time consuming or costly, the traditional Phase I/Phase II approach is not feasible. A self-starting method that sequentially updates the occurrence rate can be integrated to overcome this difficulty and leverages the use of TBE chart for cases of lack of in-control data. The motivation behind this study is to compare different self-starting TBE charts to investigate the contribution of such a sequential parameter update method. Our results indicate the potential of these schemes as they provide satisfactory performance when moderate and large sizes of base period before the shift observed. Additionally, time weighted schemes provided promising performance for relatively small sample sizes in the base period. However, our results also show a significant adverse effect in performance when the base periods are contaminated with out-of-control data.},

Trump's psychology is so unique, and so akin to that of a small child, that studying his background alone is insufficient to explain his decision-making. The evidence for this characterization of Trump's leadership comes not from his political opponents, but his allies, staffers and subordinates. Trump's lack of impulse control, short attention span and frequent temper tantrums have all undercut his effectiveness as president as compared to his predecessors. Nonetheless, the 45th president helps to clarify ongoing debates in American politics about the relative strength of the presidency as an institution. In particular, the powers of the presidency have become so enhanced that even comparatively weak and inexperienced leaders can execute dramatic policy shifts. The formal checks on presidential power, from the legislative, judicial and executive branches have all eroded. Similarly, the informal checks on the presidency had also degraded before Trump's inauguration. This article uses Trump's presidency\textemdash and his severe limitations as a decision-maker\textemdash to highlight the ways in which even a weak leader can affect change by holding a powerful office.},

However, standard Bayesian algorithms to sample from the posterior require that the likelihood function, the probability density of the data given the parameter represented as a function of the parameter for fixed observed data, is computationally tractable. However, there are an increasing number of models across Science and Technology where the likelihood function is difficult or impossible to compute. When simulation from the model is comparatively cheaper, a class of likelihood-free methods called approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) can be used. However, ABC introduces an approximation to the posterior. This article gives an introduction to ABC, describes the approximation behavior of ABC, and provides advice on the successful implementation of ABC. Some current challenges facing ABC methods are also discussed.},

To determine the number and locations of change-points of the stepwise signal, we formulate a maximum marginal likelihood estimator, which can be computed with a quadratic cost using dynamic programming. We carry out an extensive investigation on the choice of the prior distribution and study the asymptotic properties of the maximum marginal likelihood estimator. We propose to treat each possible set of change-points equally and adopt an empirical Bayes approach to specify the prior distribution of segment parameters. A detailed simulation study is performed to compare the effectiveness of this method with other existing methods. We demonstrate our method on single-molecule enzyme reaction data and on DNA array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data. Our study shows that this method is applicable to a wide range of models and offers appealing results in practice. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible and are capable of handling a much wider range of problems than the main analytical system currently in use for time series analysis, the Box-Jenkins ARIMA system. Additions to this second edition include the filtering of nonlinear and non-Gaussian series. Part I of the book obtains the mean and variance of the state, of a variable intended to measure the effect of an interaction and of regression coefficients, in terms of the observations. Part II extends the treatment to nonlinear and non-normal models. For these, analytical solutions are not available so methods are based on simulation.},

Since the function spaces induced by shallow networks have several approximation theoretic drawbacks, this explains, however, not necessarily the success of deep networks. In this article we take another route by comparing the expressive power of DNNs with ReLU activation function to linear spline methods. We show that MARS (multivariate adaptive regression splines) is improper learnable by DNNs in the sense that for any given function that can be expressed as a function in MARS with M parameters there exists a multilayer neural network with O(Mlog(M/{$\epsilon$})) parameters that approximates this function up to sup-norm error {$\epsilon$}. We show a similar result for expansions with respect to the Faber\textendash Schauder system. Based on this, we derive risk comparison inequalities that bound the statistical risk of fitting a neural network by the statistical risk of spline-based methods. This shows that deep networks perform better or only slightly worse than the considered spline methods. We provide a constructive proof for the function approximations.},

With Rcpp, the transfer of data between R and C++ is nearly seamless, and high-performance statistical computing is finally accessible to most R users. Rcpp should be part of every statistician's toolbox. -- Michael Braun, MIT Sloan School of Management "Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp" is simply a wonderful book. For anyone who uses C/C++ and R, it is an indispensable resource. The writing is outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications. This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are what most of us need to know to really do scientific programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a gentle introduction to more advanced applications via numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.), modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA Anderson School of ManagementThe Rcpp package represents a major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence, high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain. Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! -- S\o ren H\o jsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University, Denmark "Seamless R and C ++ Integration with Rcpp" provides the first comprehensive introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used language extension for R, and is deployed by over one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages. Rcpp permits users to pass scalars, vectors, matrices, list or entire R objects back and forth between R and C++ with ease. This brings the depth of the R analysis framework together with the power, speed, and efficiency of C++.Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a contributor to CRAN for over a decade and maintains around twenty packages.

Its current implementation has an interpreter at its core which may result in a performance penalty in comparison to directly executing user algorithms in the native machine code of the host CPU. In contrast, the C++~language has no built-in visualisation capabilities, handling of linear algebra or even basic statistical algorithms; however, user programs are converted to high-performance machine code, ahead of execution. A new method avoids possible speed penalties in R by using the Rcpp extension package in conjunction with the Armadillo C++~matrix library. In addition to the inherent performance advantages of compiled code, Armadillo provides an easy-to-use template-based meta-programming framework, allowing the automatic pooling of several linear algebra operations into one, which in turn can lead to further speedups. With the aid of Rcpp and Armadillo, conversion of linear algebra centred algorithms from R to C++~becomes straightforward. The algorithms retain the overall structure as well as readability, all while maintaining a bidirectional link with the host R environment. Empirical timing comparisons of R and C++~implementations of a Kalman filtering algorithm indicate a speedup of several orders of magnitude.},

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

'Big data', 'data science', and 'machine learning' have become familiar terms in the news, as statistical methods are brought to bear upon the enormous data sets of modern science and commerce. How did we get here? And where are we going? This book takes us on an exhilarating journey through the revolution in data analysis following the introduction of electronic computation in the 1950s. Beginning with classical inferential theories - Bayesian, frequentist, Fisherian - individual chapters take up a series of influential topics: survival analysis, logistic regression, empirical Bayes, the jackknife and bootstrap, random forests, neural networks, Markov chain Monte Carlo, inference after model selection, and dozens more. The distinctly modern approach integrates methodology and algorithms with statistical inference. The book ends with speculation on the future direction of statistics and data science.},

In either case, modern theory and computation allow us to present a sharp finite-sample picture of what is at stake in an empirical Bayes analysis.},

Proponents of abolition, in this view, should focus their efforts on revitalizing the tried and tested arms control formula that was implemented following the end of the Cold War. In this article, I argue that this call to make disarmament great again reflects unwarranted nostalgia for a past that never was, fostering overconfidence in established approaches to the elimination of nuclear weapons. Far from putting the world on course to nuclear abolition, the end of the Cold War saw the legitimation of nuclear weapons as a hedge against `future uncertainties' and entrenchment of the power structures that sustain the retention of nuclear armouries. By overselling past progress towards the elimination of nuclear arms, the nostalgic narrative of a lost abolitionist consensus is used to rationalize the existing nuclear order and delegitimize the pursuit of new approaches to elimination such as the movement to stigmatize nuclear weapons and the practice of nuclear deterrence.},

High-profile accounts frequently have one characteristic that makes this detection reliable -- they show consistent behavior over time. We show that our system, were it deployed, would have been able to detect and prevent three real-world attacks against popular companies and news agencies.

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference.

We propose a new method for the contextual bandit problem that is simple, practical, and can be applied with little or no domain expertise. Our algorithm relies on decision trees to model the context-reward relationship. Decision trees are non-parametric, interpretable, and work well without hand-crafted features. To guide the exploration-exploitation trade-off, we use a bootstrapping approach which abstracts Thompson sampling to non-Bayesian settings. We also discuss several computational heuristics and demonstrate the performance of our method on several datasets.},

This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the ``hardness'' of scientific research\textemdash i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors\textemdash is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a ``positive'' (full or partial) or ``negative'' support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in ``softer'' sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree.},

In fact, as discussed in recent literature, bypassing this trade-off is still an open problem which is object of intense research. To cover this gap, we develop a novel variational approximation for the posterior distribution of the coefficients in high-dimensional probit regression with Gaussian priors. Our method leverages a representation with global and local variables but, unlike for classical mean-field assumptions, it avoids a fully factorized approximation, and instead assumes a factorization only for the local variables. We prove that the resulting variational approximation belongs to a tractable class of unified skew-normal densities that crucially incorporates skewness and, unlike for state-of-the-art variational Bayes solutions, converges to the exact posterior density as the number of predictors p goes to infinity. To solve the variational optimization problem, we develop a tractable coordinate ascent variational algorithm which easily scales to p in tens of thousands, and provably requires a number of iterations converging to 1 as p goes to infinity. These findings are also illustrated in extensive simulation studies and in real-world medical applications where our methods are shown to uniformly improve classical mean-field variational Bayes in terms of inference accuracy and predictive performance. The magnitude of such gains is especially remarkable in those high-dimensional p{$>$}n settings where state-of-the-art alternative strategies are computationally impractical.},

In the first method, the certainty of the GP model prediction is used to indicate the presence of seizures. In the second approach, the hyperparameters of the GP model are used. Tests are carried out with a feature set of ten EEG measures developed from various signal processing techniques. Features are evaluated using a neural network classifier on 51 h of real neonatal EEG. The GP measures, in particular, the prediction certainty approach, produce a high level of performance compared to other modeling methods and methods currently in clinical use for EEG analysis, indicating that they are an important and useful tool for the real-time detection of neonatal seizures.},

  abstract = {A generalized multisensor sequential change detection problem is considered, in which a number of (possibly correlated) sensors monitor an environment in real time, the joint distribution of their observations is determined by a global parameter vector, and at some unknown time there is a change in an unknown subset of components of this parameter vector. The goal is to detect the change as soon as possible, while controlling the rate of false alarms. We establish the second-order asymptotic optimality (with respect to Lorden's criterion) of various generalizations of the CUSUM rule; that is, we show that their additional expected worst case detection delay (relative to the one that could be achieved if the affected subset was known) remains bounded as the rate of false alarm goes to 0, for any possible subset of affected components. This general framework incorporates the traditional multisensor setup in which only an unknown subset of sensors is affected by the change. The latter problem has a special structure which we exploit in order to obtain feasible representations of the proposed schemes. We present the results of a simulation study where we compare the proposed schemes with scalable detection rules that are only first-order asymptotically optimal. Finally, in the special case that the change affects exactly one sensor, we consider the scheme that runs in parallel the local CUSUM rules and study the problem of specifying the local thresholds.},

The proposed test statistic is scalar-invariant and thus is particularly useful when different components have different scales in high-dimensional data. Asymptotic properties of the test statistic are studied. Compared with other existing approaches, simulation studies show that the proposed method behaves well in terms of sizes and power.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to statistical problems, though fruitful in many ways, has been rather unsuccessful in treating nonparametric problems. This is due primarily to the difficulty in finding workable prior distributions on the parameter space, which in nonparametric ploblems is taken to be a set of probability distributions on a given sample space. There are two desirable properties of a prior distribution for nonparametric problems. (I) The support of the prior distribution should be large--with respect to some suitable topology on the space of probability distributions on the sample space. (II) Posterior distributions given a sample of observations from the true probability distribution should be manageable analytically. These properties are antagonistic in the sense that one may be obtained at the expense of the other. This paper presents a class of prior distributions, called Dirichlet process priors, broad in the sense of (I), for which (II) is realized, and for which treatment of many nonparametric statistical problems may be carried out, yielding results that are comparable to the classical theory. In Section 2, we review the properties of the Dirichlet distribution needed for the description of the Dirichlet process given in Section 3. Briefly, this process may be described as follows. Let \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$ be a space and \$\textbackslash mathscr\{A\}\$ a \$\textbackslash sigma\$-field of subsets, and let \$\textbackslash alpha\$ be a finite non-null measure on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$. Then a stochastic process \$P\$ indexed by elements \$A\$ of \$\textbackslash mathscr\{A\}\$, is said to be a Dirichlet process on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$ with parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$ if for any measurable partition \$(A\_1, \textbackslash cdots, A\_k)\$ of \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$, the random vector \$(P(A\_1), \textbackslash cdots, P(A\_k))\$ has a Dirichlet distribution with parameter \$(\textbackslash alpha(A\_1), \textbackslash cdots, \textbackslash alpha(A\_k)). P\$ may be considered a random probability measure on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$, The main theorem states that if \$P\$ is a Dirichlet process on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$ with parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$, and if \$X\_1, \textbackslash cdots, X\_n\$ is a sample from \$P\$, then the posterior distribution of \$P\$ given \$X\_1, \textbackslash cdots, X\_n\$ is also a Dirichlet process on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$ with a parameter \$\textbackslash alpha + \textbackslash sum\^n\_1 \textbackslash delta\_\{x\_i\}\$, where \$\textbackslash delta\_x\$ denotes the measure giving mass one to the point \$x\$. In Section 4, an alternative definition of the Dirichlet process is given. This definition exhibits a version of the Dirichlet process that gives probability one to the set of discrete probability measures on \$(\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}, \textbackslash mathscr\{A\})\$. This is in contrast to Dubins and Freedman [2], whose methods for choosing a distribution function on the interval [0, 1] lead with probability one to singular continuous distributions. Methods of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1] that with probability one is absolutely continuous have been described by Kraft [7]. The general method of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1], described in Section 2 of Kraft and van Eeden [10], can of course be used to define the Dirichlet process on [0, 1]. Special mention must be made of the papers of Freedman and Fabius. Freedman [5] defines a notion of tailfree for a distribution on the set of all probability measures on a countable space \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$. For a tailfree prior, posterior distribution given a sample from the true probability measure may be fairly easily computed. Fabius [3] extends the notion of tailfree to the case where \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$ is the unit interval [0, 1], but it is clear his extension may be made to cover quite general \$\textbackslash mathscr\{X\}\$. With such an extension, the Dirichlet process would be a special case of a tailfree distribution for which the posterior distribution has a particularly simple form. There are disadvantages to the fact that \$P\$ chosen by a Dirichlet process is discrete with probability one. These appear mainly because in sampling from a \$P\$ chosen by a Dirichlet process, we expect eventually to see one observation exactly equal to another. For example, consider the goodness-of-fit problem of testing the hypothesis \$H\_0\$ that a distribution on the interval [0, 1] is uniform. If on the alternative hypothesis we place a Dirichlet process prior with parameter \$\textbackslash alpha\$ itself a uniform measure on [0, 1], and if we are given a sample of size \$n \textbackslash geqq 2\$, the only nontrivial nonrandomized Bayes rule is to reject \$H\_0\$ if and only if two or more of the observations are exactly equal. This is really a test of the hypothesis that a distribution is continuous against the hypothesis that it is discrete. Thus, there is still a need for a prior that chooses a continuous distribution with probability one and yet satisfies properties (I) and (II). Some applications in which the possible doubling up of the values of the observations plays no essential role are presented in Section 5. These include the estimation of a distribution function, of a mean, of quantiles, of a variance and of a covariance. A two-sample problem is considered in which the Mann-Whitney statistic, equivalent to the rank-sum statistic, appears naturally. A decision theoretic upper tolerance limit for a quantile is also treated. Finally, a hypothesis testing problem concerning a quantile is shown to yield the sign test. In each of these problems, useful ways of combining prior information with the statistical observations appear. Other applications exist. In his Ph. D. dissertation [1], Charles Antoniak finds a need to consider mixtures of Dirichlet processes. He treats several problems, including the estimation of a mixing distribution, bio-assay, empirical Bayes problems, and discrimination problems.},

However, this relation changes abruptly when the variable concentration reaches an unknown threshold level, the so-called change point. In the context of analytical chemistry, there are many methods that describe the relationship between absorbance and concentration, but none of them provide inferential procedures to detect change points. In this paper, we propose partially linear models with a change point separating the parametric and nonparametric components. The Schwarz information criterion is used to locate a change point. A back-fitting algorithm is presented to obtain parameter estimates and the penalized Fisher information matrix is obtained to calculate the standard errors of the parameter estimates. To examine the proposed method, we present a simulation study. Finally, we apply the method to data sets from the chemistry area. The partially linear models with a change point developed in this paper are useful supplements to other methods of absorbance\textendash concentration analysis in chemical studies, for example, and in many other practical applications.},

At every time step, the decision maker selects a set of arms and observes a reward from each of the chosen arms. In this paper, we present a variant of the problem, which we call the Scaling MAB (S-MAB): The goal of the decision maker is not only to maximize the cumulative rewards, i.e., choosing the arms with the highest expected reward, but also to decide how many arms to select so that, in expectation, the cost of selecting arms does not exceed the rewards. This problem is relevant to many real-world applications, e.g., online advertising, financial investments or data stream monitoring. We propose an extension of Thompson Sampling, which has strong theoretical guarantees and is reported to perform well in practice. Our extension dynamically controls the number of arms to draw. Furthermore, we combine the proposed method with ADWIN, a state-of-the-art change detector, to deal with non-static environments. We illustrate the benefits of our contribution via a real-world use case on predictive maintenance.},

  abstract = {This paper is about detecting activations in statistical parametric maps and considers the relative sensitivity of a nested hierarchy of tests that we have framed in terms of the level of inference (voxel level, cluster level, and set level). These tests are based on the probability of obtaining c, or more, clusters with k, or more, voxels, above a threshold u. This probability has a reasonably simple form and is derived using distributional approximations from the theory of Gaussian fields. The most important contribution of this work is the notion of set-level inference. Set-level inference refers to the statistical inference that the number of clusters comprising an observed activation profile is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. This inference pertains to the set of activations reaching criteria and represents a new way of assigning P values to distributed effects. Cluster-level inferences are a special case of set-level inferences, which obtain when the number of clusters c = 1. Similarly voxel-level inferences are special cases of cluster-level inferences that result when the cluster can be very small (i.e., k = 0). Using a theoretical power analysis of distributed activations, we observed that set-level inferences are generally more powerful than cluster-level inferences and that cluster-level inferences are generally more powerful than voxel-level inferences. The price paid for this increased sensitivity is reduced localizing power: Voxel-level tests permit individual voxels to be identified as significant, whereas cluster-and set-level inferences only allow clusters or sets of clusters to be so identified. For all levels of inference the spatial size of the underlying signal f (relative to resolution) determines the most powerful thresholds to adopt. For set-level inferences if f is large (e.g., fMRI) then the optimum extent threshold should be greater than the expected number of voxels for each cluster. If f is small (e.g., PET) the extent threshold should be small. We envisage that set-level inferences will find a role in making statistical inferences about distributed activations, particularly in fMRI.},

  abstract = {Missile defence plays an increasing role in NATO and in most US alliances in Asia, which raises the question of what impact it has on the management of extended deterrence. Extended deterrence relies on the threat of escalation. Since the costs of escalation are different for different allies, the management of extended deterrence is inherently difficult. Missile defence shifts the relative costs of conflict, and therefore also impacts on the alliance bargains that underpin agreement on extended deterrence strategy. Although increased defensive capacity is a clear net benefit, the strategic effects of its deployment and use can still be complex if, for example, missile defence increases the chances of localizing a conflict. The article discusses the role of missile defences for the US homeland, and of the territory and population of US allies, for extended deterrence credibility and the reassurance of US allies in Asia and in NATO. It argues that there is increased scope in strengthening deterrence by enmeshing the defence of the US homeland with that of its allies, and that allies need to pay closer attention to the way the deployment and use of missile defence influence pressures for escalation. In general, missile defence thus reinforces the need for the United States and its allies in Europe and Asia to negotiate an overall alliance strategy.},

This book covers the best-known spatial models for three types of spatial data: geostatistical data (stationarity, intrinsic models, variograms, spatial regression and space-time models), areal data (Gibbs-Markov fields and spatial auto-regression) and point pattern data (Poisson, Cox, Gibbs and Markov point processes). The level is relatively advanced, and the presentation concise but complete. The most important statistical methods and their asymptotic properties are described, including estimation in geostatistics, autocorrelation and second-order statistics, maximum likelihood methods, approximate inference using the pseudo-likelihood or Monte-Carlo simulations, statistics for point processes and Bayesian hierarchical models. A chapter is devoted to Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation (Gibbs sampler, Metropolis-Hastings algorithms and exact simulation).A large number of real examples are studied with R, and each chapter ends with a set of theoretical and applied exercises. While a foundation in probability and mathematical statistics is assumed, three appendices introduce some necessary background. The book is accessible to senior undergraduate students with a solid math background and Ph.D. students in statistics. Furthermore, experienced statisticians and researchers in the above-mentioned fields will find the book valuable as a mathematically sound reference.

  abstract = {We consider the following fundamental problem in the context of channelized dynamic spectrum access. There are M secondary users and N \textquestiondown{} M orthogonal channels. Each secondary user requires a single channel for operation that does not conflict with the channels assigned to the other users. Due to geographic dispersion, each secondary user can potentially see different primary user occupancy behavior on each channel. Time is divided into discrete decision rounds. The throughput obtainable from spectrum opportunities on each user-channel combination over a decision period is modeled as an arbitrarily-distributed random variable with bounded support but unknown mean, i.i.d. over time. The objective is to search for an allocation of channels for all users that maximizes the expected sum throughput. We formulate this problem as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (MAB), in which each arm corresponds to a matching of the users to channels. Unlike most prior work on multi-armed bandits, this combinatorial formulation results in dependent arms. Moreover, the number of arms grows super-exponentially as the permutation P(N, M). We present a novel matching-learning algorithm with polynomial storage and polynomial computation per decision period for this problem, and prove that it results in a regret (the gap between the expected sum-throughput obtained by a genie-aided perfect allocation and that obtained by this algorithm) that is uniformly upper-bounded for all time n by a function that grows as O(M4Nlogn), i.e. polynomial in the number of unknown parameters and logarithmic in time. We also discuss how our results provide a non-trivial generalization of known theoretical results on multi-armed bandits.},

Furthermore, we show that simple adaptations of the KL-UCB algorithm are also optimal for specific classes of (possibly unbounded) rewards, including those generated from exponential families of distributions. A large-scale numerical study comparing KL-UCB with its main competitors (UCB, UCB2, UCB-Tuned, UCB-V, DMED) shows that KL-UCB is remarkably efficient and stable, including for short time horizons. KL-UCB is also the only method that always performs better than the basic UCB policy. Our regret bounds rely on deviations results of independent interest which are stated and proved in the Appendix. As a by-product, we also obtain an improved regret bound for the standard UCB algorithm.},

Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

  abstract = {We propose a new prior distribution for classical (nonhierarchical) logistic regression models, constructed by first scaling all nonbinary variables to have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, and then placing independent Student-t prior distributions on the coefficients. As a default choice, we recommend the Cauchy distribution with center 0 and scale 2.5, which in the simplest setting is a longer-tailed version of the distribution attained by assuming one-half additional success and one-half additional failure in a logistic regression. Cross-validation on a corpus of datasets shows the Cauchy class of prior distributions to outperform existing implementations of Gaussian and Laplace priors. We recommend this prior distribution as a default choice for routine applied use. It has the advantage of always giving answers, even when there is complete separation in logistic regression (a common problem, even when the sample size is large and the number of predictors is small), and also automatically applying more shrinkage to higher-order interactions. This can be useful in routine data analysis as well as in automated procedures such as chained equations for missing-data imputation. We implement a procedure to fit generalized linear models in R with the Student-t prior distribution by incorporating an approximate EM algorithm into the usual iteratively weighted least squares. We illustrate with several applications, including a series of logistic regressions predicting voting preferences, a small bioassay experiment, and an imputation model for a public health data set.},

We argue that the words `objective' and `subjective' in statistics discourse are used in a mostly unhelpful way, and we propose to replace each of them with broader collections of attributes, with objectivity replaced by transparency, consensus, impartiality and correspondence to observable reality, and subjectivity replaced by awareness of multiple perspectives and context dependence. Together with stability, these make up a collection of virtues that we think is helpful in discussions of statistical foundations and practice. The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other and that they give more specific guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgement of multiple perspectives as complementary goals. We demonstrate the implications of our proposal with recent applied examples from pharmacology, election polling and socio-economic stratification. The aim of the paper is to push users and developers of statistical methods towards more effective use of diverse sources of information and more open acknowledgement of assumptions and goals.},

Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and using these models, along with many remaining challenges in computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world problems requires not only statistical skills, subject matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow also includes iterative model building, model checking, validation and troubleshooting of computational problems, model understanding, and model comparison. We review all these aspects of workflow in the context of several examples, keeping in mind that in practice we will be fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our conclusions.},

Existing algorithms for community detection assume the knowledge of the number of clusters or estimate it a priori using various selection criteria and subsequently estimate the community structure. Ignoring the uncertainty in the first stage may lead to erroneous clustering, particularly when the community structure is vague. We instead propose a coherent probabilistic framework for simultaneous estimation of the number of communities and the community structure, adapting recently developed Bayesian nonparametric techniques to network models. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed which obviates the need to perform reversible jump MCMC on the number of clusters. The methodology is shown to outperform recently developed community detection algorithms in a variety of synthetic data examples and in benchmark real-datasets. Using an appropriate metric on the space of all configurations, we develop nonasymptotic Bayes risk bounds even when the number of clusters is unknown. Enroute, we develop concentration properties of nonlinear functions of Bernoulli random variables, which may be of independent interest in analysis of related models.

This article examines the rationale for NATO enlargement in the post-Cold War era, focusing on the two post-Soviet aspirant states, Georgia and Ukraine. While these two states contribute, as partners, to the alliance's efforts to advance cooperative security, the issue of their prospective membership threatens to undermine alliance security and cohesion, and their ambitions are therefore unlikely to be realized in the foreseeable future. With Russia taking an increasingly assertive stance on the global stage and uncertainty surrounding the direction of US foreign policy under the presidency of Donald Trump, the issue of NATO enlargement is unlikely to be a priority for the alliance over the next few years. If NATO ultimately rejects any prospect of membership for states in the post-Soviet space, they could be abandoned to Russian influence, indicating that Moscow has a de facto veto over membership of the alliance and conceding spheres of influence to Russia.},

The non-stationarity is modeled using a Poisson arrival process, which changes the mean of the rewards on each arrival. The proposed strategy compares the empirical mean of the recent rewards of an arm with the estimate of the mean of the rewards from its history. It detects a change when the empirical mean deviates from the mean estimate by a value larger than a threshold. Then, we characterize the lower bound on the duration of the time-window for which the bandit framework must remain stationary for TS-CD to successfully detect a change when it occurs. Consequently, our results highlight an upper bound on the parameter for the Poisson arrival process, for which the TS-CD achieves asymptotic regret optimality with high probability. Finally, we validate the efficacy of TS-CD by testing it for edge-control of radio access technique (RAT)-selection in a wireless network. Our results show that TS-CD not only outperforms the classical max-power RAT selection strategy but also other actively adaptive and passively adaptive bandit algorithms that are designed for non-stationary environments.},

Because understanding the behavior of posteriors is critical to selecting priors that work, the large sample theory is developed systematically, illustrated by various examples of model and prior combinations. Precise sufficient conditions are given, with complete proofs, that ensure desirable posterior properties and behavior. Each chapter ends with historical notes and numerous exercises to deepen and consolidate the reader's understanding, making the book valuable for both graduate students and researchers in statistics and machine learning, as well as in application areas such as econometrics and biostatistics.},

  abstract = {Bayesian nonparametrics has grown tremendously in the last three decades, especially in the last few years. This book is the first systematic treatment of Bayesian nonparametric methods and the theory behind them. While the book is of special interest to Bayesians, it will also appeal to statisticians in general because Bayesian nonparametrics offers a whole continuous spectrum of robust alternatives to purely parametric and purely nonparametric methods of classical statistics. The book is primarily aimed at graduate students and can be used as the text for a graduate course in Bayesian nonparametrics. Though the emphasis of the book is on nonparametrics, there is a substantial chapter on asymptotics of classical Bayesian parametric models. Jayanta Ghosh has been Director and Jawaharlal Nehru Professor at the Indian Statistical Institute and President of the International Statistical Institute. He is currently professor of statistics at Purdue University. He has been editor of Sankhya and served on the editorial boards of several journals including the Annals of Statistics. Apart from Bayesian analysis, his interests include asymptotics, stochastic modeling, high dimensional model selection, reliability and survival analysis and bioinformatics. R.V. Ramamoorthi is professor at the Department of Statistics and Probability at Michigan State University. He has published papers in the areas of sufficiency invariance, comparison of experiments, nonparametric survival analysis and Bayesian analysis. In addition to Bayesian nonparametrics, he is currently interested in Bayesian networks and graphical models. He is on the editorial board of Sankhya.},

Scholarship in international relations theory generally assumes that rising states benefit from the ``advantage of backwardness.'' That is, by free riding on the research and technology of the most advanced countries, less developed states can allegedly close the military-technological gap with their rivals relatively easily and quickly. More recent works maintain that globalization, the emergence of dual-use components, and advances in communications have facilitated this process. This literature is built on shaky theoretical foundations, however, and its claims lack empirical support. In particular, it largely ignores one of the most important changes to have occurred in the realm of weapons development since the second industrial revolution: the exponential increase in the complexity of military technology. This increase in complexity has promoted a change in the system of production that has made the imitation and replication of the performance of state-of-the-art weapon systems harder\textemdash so much so as to offset the diffusing effects of globalization and advances in communications. An examination of the British-German naval rivalry (1890\textendash 1915) and China's efforts to imitate U.S. stealth fighters supports these findings.},

This article proposes an adaptive sampling strategy for online monitoring and diagnosis with partially observed data. The proposed methodology integrates two novel ideas (i) the recursive projection of the high-dimensional streaming data onto a low-dimensional subspace to capture the spatio-temporal structure of the data while performing missing data imputation; and (ii) the development of an adaptive sampling scheme, balancing exploration and exploitation, to decide where to collect data at each acquisition time. Through simulations and two case studies, the proposed framework's performance is evaluated and compared with benchmark methods.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

DATA SOURCES: Review of the English-language literature since 1970 on the effect of estrogen therapy and estrogen plus progestin therapy on endometrial cancer, breast cancer, coronary heart disease, osteoporosis, and stroke. We used standard meta-analytic statistical methods to pool estimates from studies to determine summary relative risks for these diseases in hormone users and modified lifetable methods to estimate changes in lifetime probability and life expectancy due to use of hormone regimens. RESULTS: There is evidence that estrogen therapy decreases risk for coronary heart disease and for hip fracture, but long-term estrogen therapy increases risk for endometrial cancer and may be associated with a small increase in risk for breast cancer. The increase in endometrial cancer risk can probably be avoided by adding a progestin to the estrogen regimen for women who have a uterus, but the effects of combination hormones on risk for other diseases has not been adequately studied. We present estimates for changes in lifetime probabilities of disease and life expectancy due to hormone therapy in women who have had a hysterectomy; with coronary heart disease; and at increased risk for coronary heart disease, hip fracture, and breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Hormone therapy should probably be recommended for women who have had a hysterectomy and for those with coronary heart disease or at high risk for coronary heart disease. For other women, the best course of action is unclear.},

  abstract = {A nonparametric Shewhart-type control chart is proposed for monitoring the location of a continuous variable in a Phase I process control setting. The chart is based on the pooled median of the available Phase I samples and the charting statistics are the counts (number of observations) in each sample that are less than the pooled median. An exact expression for the false alarm probability (FAP) is given in terms of the multivariate hypergeometric distribution and this is used to provide tables for the control limits for a specified nominal FAP value (of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10, respectively) and for some values of the sample size (n) and the number of Phase I samples (m).

We focus mostly on the class of random distributions that induces a Dirichlet process at each covariate value. We derive the correlation between distributions at different covariate values and use a point process to implement a practically useful type of ordering. Two main constructions with analytically known correlation structures are proposed. Practical and efficient computational methods are introduced. We apply our framework, through mixtures of these processes, to regression modeling, the modeling of stochastic volatility in time series data, and spatial geostatistical modeling.},

The effective application of Bayesian variable selection methods for regression with these datasets has proved difficult since available Markov chain Monte Carlo methods do not perform well in typical problem sizes of interest. We propose new adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to address this shortcoming. The adaptive design of these algorithms exploits the observation that in large-\$p\$, small-\$n\$ settings, the majority of the \$p\$ variables will be approximately uncorrelated a posteriori. The algorithms adaptively build suitable nonlocal proposals that result in moves with squared jumping distance significantly larger than standard methods. Their performance is studied empirically in high-dimensional problems and speed-ups of up to four orders of magnitude are observed.},

Multi-variety and small batch production runs are common in manufacturing environments like flexible manufacturing systems and Just-in-Time systems, which are characterized by a wide variety of mixed products with small volume for each kind of production. It is difficult to apply traditional control charts efficiently and effectively in such environments. The method that control charts are plotted for each individual part is not proper, since the successive state of the manufacturing process cannot be reflected. In this paper, a proper t-chart is proposed for implementation in multi-variety and small batch production runs to monitor the process mean, and its statistical properties are evaluated. The run length distribution of the proposed t-chart has been obtained by modelling the multi-variety process. The ARL performance for various shifts, number of product types, and subgroup sizes has also been obtained. The results show that the t-chart can be successfully implemented to monitor a multi-variety production run. Finally, illustrative examples show that the proposed t-chart is effective in multi-variety and small batch manufacturing environment. Copyright  2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

On the one hand, the detection scheme should be able to deal with partially observable data and meanwhile have efficient detection power for sparse changes. On the other, the scheme should be able to adaptively and actively select the most important variables to observe to maximize the detection power. To address these two points, in this paper, we propose a novel detection scheme called CDSSD. In particular, it describes the structure of high dimensional data with sparse changes by smooth-sparse decomposition, whose parameters can be learned via spike-slab variational Bayesian inference. Then the posterior Bayes factor, which incorporates the learned parameters and sparse change information, is formulated as a detection statistic. Finally, by formulating the statistic as the reward of a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, an adaptive sampling strategy based on Thompson sampling is proposed. The efficacy and applicability of our method in practice are demonstrated with numerical studies and a real case study.},

However, different thresholds are required to adapt to different contexts of screening problems and an appropriate thresholding magnitude usually varies from the model and error distribution. With an ad-hoc choice, it is unclear whether all of the important predictors are selected or not, and it is very likely that the procedures would include many unimportant features. We introduce a data-adaptive threshold selection procedure with error rate control, which is applicable to most kinds of popular screening methods. The key idea is to apply the sample-splitting strategy to construct a series of statistics with marginal symmetry property and then to utilize the symmetry for obtaining an approximation to the number of false discoveries. We show that the proposed method is able to asymptotically control the false discovery rate and per family error rate under certain conditions and still retains all of the important predictors. Three important examples are presented to illustrate the merits of the new proposed procedures. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed methodology works well for many existing screening methods.},

  abstract = {The importance of multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems is on the rise due to their recent application in a large variety of areas such as online advertising, news article selection, wireless networks, and medicinal trials, to name a few. The most common assumption made when solving such MAB problems is that the unknown reward probability \texttheta k of each bandit arm k is fixed. However, this assumption rarely holds in practice simply because real-life problems often involve underlying processes that are dynamically evolving. In this paper, we model problems where reward probabilities \texttheta k are drifting, and introduce a new method called Dynamic Thompson Sampling (DTS) that facilitates Order Statistics based Thompson Sampling for these dynamically evolving MABs. The DTS algorithm adapts its success probability estimates, hat \texttheta k, faster than traditional Thompson Sampling schemes and thus leads to improved performance in terms of lower regret. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, namely pure Thompson Sampling, UCB-Normal and UCBf, for the case of dynamic reward probabilities. Furthermore, this performance advantage increases persistently with the number of bandit arms.},

In these circumstances, nonparametric approaches with greater flexibility in modeling the complicated profiles are adopted. In this research, the spline smoothing method is used to model a complicated non-linear profile and the Hotelling T2 control chart based on the spline coefficients is used to monitor the process. After receiving an out-of-control signal, a maximum likelihood estimator is employed for change point estimation. The simulation studies, which include both global and local shifts, provide appropriate evaluation of the performance of the proposed estimation and monitoring procedure.

We, moreover, extend to the multivariate setting two famous univariate results: the traditional Chernoff-Savage (1958) property, showing that Hotelling's traditional procedure is uniformly dominated, in the Pitman sense, by the van der Waerden version of our tests, and the celebrated Hodges-Lehmann (1956) ".864 result," providing, for any fixed space dimension k, the lower bound for the asymptotic relative efficiency of Wilcoxon-type tests with respect to Hotelling's. These asymptotic results are confirmed by a Monte Carlo investigation, and application to a real data set.},

Contrary to the existing parametric procedures, these tests remain valid without any moment assumptions, and thus are perfectly robust against heavy-tailed distributions (validity robustness). Nevertheless, they reach semiparametric efficiency bounds at correctly specified elliptical densities and maintain high powers under all (efficiency robustness). In particular, their normal-score version outperforms traditional Gaussian likelihood ratio tests and their pseudo-Gaussian robustifications under a very broad range of non-Gaussian densities including, for instance, all multivariate Student and power-exponential distributions.},

  abstract = {Goodness-of-fit tests based on the empirical Wasserstein distance are proposed for simple and composite null hypotheses involving general multivariate distributions. For group families, the procedure is to be implemented after preliminary reduction of the data via invariance. This property allows for calculation of exact critical values and p-values at finite sample sizes. Applications include testing for location\textendash scale families and testing for families arising from affine transformations, such as elliptical distributions with given standard radial density and unspecified location vector and scatter matrix. A novel test for multivariate normality with unspecified mean vector and covariance matrix arises as a special case. For more general parametric families, we propose a parametric bootstrap procedure to calculate critical values. The lack of asymptotic distribution theory for the empirical Wasserstein distance means that the validity of the parametric bootstrap under the null hypothesis remains a conjecture. Nevertheless, we show that the test is consistent against fixed alternatives. To this end, we prove a uniform law of large numbers for the empirical distribution in Wasserstein distance, where the uniformity is over any class of underlying distributions satisfying a uniform integrability condition but no additional moment assumptions. The calculation of test statistics boils down to solving the well-studied semi-discrete optimal transport problem. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the practical feasibility and the excellent performance of the proposed tests for the Wasserstein distance of order p=1 and p=2 and for dimensions at least up to d=5. The simulations also lend support to the conjecture of the asymptotic validity of the parametric bootstrap.},

In addition, he presents basic tools for analyzing dynamic systems (including linear representations, autocovariance generating functions, spectral analysis, and the Kalman filter) in a way that integrates economic theory with the practical difficulties of analyzing and interpreting real-world data. Time Series Analysis fills an important need for a textbook that integrates economic theory, econometrics, and new results. The book is intended to provide students and researchers with a self-contained survey of time series analysis. It starts from first principles and should be readily accessible to any beginning graduate student, while it is also intended to serve as a reference book for researchers.},

To analyze the bivariate data on related survival times (e.g., matched pairs experiments, twin or family data) the shared frailty models were suggested. Shared frailty models are used despite their limitations. To overcome their disadvantages correlated frailty models may be used. In this article, we introduce the gamma correlated frailty models with two different baseline distributions namely, the generalized log logistic, and the generalized Weibull. We introduce the Bayesian estimation procedure using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to estimate the parameters involved in these models. We present a simulation study to compare the true values of the parameters with the estimated values. Also we apply these models to a real life bivariate survival dataset related to the kidney infection data and a better model is suggested for the data.},

An alternative approach is proposed which not only reveals a relation but also offers a very simple formulation of the decision process involved in model monitoring. This is first illustrated for a Normal mean and then extended to other important practical cases including Dynamic Models. For V-mask cusum graphs a particular feature is the interpretation of the distance of the V vertex from the latest plotted point in terms of the prior precision as measured in `equivalent' observations.},

After identifying unacceptable weaknesses associated with Wald, sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) and Cuscore monitors, the Bayes decision monitor is developed. In particular, the paper focuses on what is termed a 'popular decision scheme' (PDS) for which the monitoring run loss functions are specified simply in terms of two indiff erence qualities. For most applications, the PDS results in forward cumulative sum tests of functions of the observations. For many exponential family applications, the PDS is equivalent to well-used SPRTs and Cusums. In particular, a neat interpretation of V-mask cusum chart settings is derived when simultaneously running two symmetric PDSs. However, apart from providing a decision theoretic basis for monitoring, sensible procedures occur in applications for which SPRTs and Cuscores are particularly unsatisfactory. Average run lengths (ARLs) are given for two special cases, and the inadequacy of the Wald and similar ARL approximations is revealed. Generalizations and applications to normal and dynamic linear models are discussed. The paper concludes by deriving conditions under which sequences of forward and backward sequential or Cusum chart tests are equivalent.},

This paper uses the running mean and standard deviation of all observations made on the process since start-up as substitutes for the unknown true values of the process mean and standard deviation. Using some theoretical properties of independence of residuals, two pairs of cusums are set up: one testing for constancy of location of the process, and the other for constancy of the spread. While the process is under control, both these cusum pairs are of approximately normal \$N(0, 1)\$ quantities (and therefore are well understood), but if the location, the spread or both change, then non-centrality is introduced into one or both of the location and scale cusum pairs, and it drifts out-of-control. It is shown that the procedure performs well in detecting changes in the process, even in comparison with the often utopian situation in which the process mean and variance are known exactly prior to the start of the cusum.},

The common methodologies, such as Shewhart, cumulative sum (cusum), and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charting, require the in-control values of the process parameters, but these are rarely known accurately. Using estimated parameters, the run length behavior changes randomly from one realization to another, making it impossible to control the run length behavior of any particular chart. A suitable methodology for detecting and diagnosing step changes based on imperfect process knowledge is the unknown-parameter changepoint formulation. Long recognized as a Phase I analysis tool, we argue that it is also highly effective in allowing the user to progress seamlessly from the start of Phase I data gathering through Phase II SPC monitoring. Despite not requiring specification of the post-change process parameter values, its performance is never far short of that of the optimal cusum chart which requires this knowledge, and it is far superior for shifts away from the cusum shift for which the cusum chart is optimal. As another benefit, while changepoint methods are designed for step changes that persist, they are also competitive with the Shewhart chart, the chart of choice for isolated non-sustained special causes.},

Conventionally, this is done by pairs of charts\textemdash Shewhart X and S (or R) charts, cumulative sum charts for mean and for variance, or exponentially weighted moving average charts for mean and variance. The traditional methods of calculating the statistical properties of control charts are based on the assumption that the in-control true mean and variance were known exactly, and use these assumed true values to set center lines, control limits, and decision intervals. The reality, however, is that true parameter values are seldom if ever known exactly; rather, they are commonly estimated from a phase I sample. The random errors in the estimates lead to uncertain run length distribution of the resulting charts. An attractive alternative to the traditional charting methods is a single chart using the unknown-parameter likelihood ratio test for a change in mean and/or variance in normally distributed data. This formulation gives a single diagnostic to detect a shift in mean, in variance, or in both, rather than two separate diagnostics. Using the unknown parameter formulation recognizes the reality that at best one has reasonable estimates of parameters and not their exact values. This description implies an immediate benefit of the formulation, that the run behavior is controlled despite the lack of a large phase I sample. We demonstrate another benefit, that the changepoint formulation is competitive with the best of traditional formulations for detecting step changes in parameters.},

  abstract = {A control chart for detecting shifts in the variance of a process is developed for the case where the nominal value of the variance is unknown. As our approach does not require that the in-control variance be known a priori, it avoids the need for a lengthy Phase I data-gathering step before charting can begin. The method is a variance-change-point model, based on the likelihood ratio test for a change in variance with the conventional Bartlett correction, adapted for repeated sequential use. The chart may be used alone in settings where one wishes to monitor one-degree-of-freedom chi-squared variates for departure from control; or it may be used together with a parallel change-point methodology for the mean to monitor process data for shifts in mean and/or variance. In both the solo use and as the scale portion of a combined scheme for monitoring changes in mean and/or variance, the approach has good performance across the range of possible shifts.},

  abstract = {Multivariate control charts are valuable tools for industrial quality control. The conventional discussion of them rests on the presumption that the in-control process parameters are known a priori. The more common reality is that practitioners plug in parameter estimates gathered from a special phase I sample to establish parameter values for the charts. But no sample will establish the exact process parameters, and quite small random errors translate into serious distortions of the run behavior, particularly of sensitive charts, and can affect chart performance. So-called ``self-starting'' methods can begin the control of the process right after startup without the preliminary step of a large phase I sample. Univariate self-starting methods for converting the unknown-parameter stream of process readings into a known-parameter sequence have been available for some time now. This article develops a multivariate equivalent by providing a way to transform the process readings into a stream of vectors following an exact known-parameter distribution. Although our approach is far from being the first proposal for self-starting charting of multivariate data, we believe it is the first that does so by transforming the unknown-parameter process vectors into known-parameter vectors of the same dimensionality. This stream of vectors has many potential uses. In particular, it may be used to construct any multivariate control chart, such as Hotelling'sT2, or any of the multivariate cusum methods. We illustrate using the transformed stream to set up a multivariate exponentially weighted moving average chart. With the self-starting front end, this (or any other) chart will have the same in-control properties as if the true process mean and covariance matrix were known exactly, thereby allowing multivariate control charting to proceed without a large and costly phase I data-gathering exercise.},

The well-known MEWMA is directed at changes in the mean vector.

This article discusses an exponentially weighted moving covariance matrix for monitoring the stability of the covariance matrix of a process. Used together with the location MEWMA, this chart provides a way to satisfy Shewhart's dictum that proper process control monitor both mean and variability.

  abstract = {In the multiple changepoint setting, various search methods have been proposed, which involve optimizing either a constrained or penalized cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints using dynamic programming. Recent work in the penalized optimization setting has focused on developing an exact pruning-based approach that, under certain conditions, is linear in the number of data points. Such an approach naturally requires the specification of a penalty to avoid under/over-fitting. Work has been undertaken to identify the appropriate penalty choice for data-generating processes with known distributional form, but in many applications the model assumed for the data is not correct and these penalty choices are not always appropriate. To this end, we present a method that enables us to find the solution path for all choices of penalty values across a continuous range. This permits an evaluation of the various segmentations to identify a suitable penalty choice. The computational complexity of this approach can be linear in the number of data points and linear in the difference between the number of changepoints in the optimal segmentations for the smallest and largest penalty values.

  abstract = {In this paper we build on an approach proposed by Zou et al. (2014) for nonparametric changepoint detection. This approach defines the best segmentation for a data set as the one which minimises a penalised cost function, with the cost function defined in term of minus a non-parametric log-likelihood for data within each segment. Minimising this cost function is possible using dynamic programming, but their algorithm had a computational cost that is cubic in the length of the data set. To speed up computation, Zou et al. (2014) resorted to a screening procedure which means that the estimated segmentation is no longer guaranteed to be the global minimum of the cost function. We show that the screening procedure adversely affects the accuracy of the changepoint detection method, and show how a faster dynamic programming algorithm, pruned exact linear time (PELT) (Killick et al. 2012), can be used to find the optimal segmentation with a computational cost that can be close to linear in the amount of data. PELT requires a penalty to avoid under/over-fitting the model which can have a detrimental effect on the quality of the detected changepoints. To overcome this issue we use a relatively new method, changepoints over a range of penalties (Haynes et al. 2016), which finds all of the optimal segmentations for multiple penalty values over a continuous range. We apply our method to detect changes in heart-rate during physical activity.},

PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94\% top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset. This is a 26\% relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66\%).

Through a comparative case study of the institutionalization of the Asia\textendash Pacific vs the Indo-Pacific, we argue that two crucial factors contributed to the slow institutionalization of the Indo-Pacific as a regional system in world politics: the lack of ideational leadership from an epistemic community and the weak executive leadership from a powerful state. While ideational leaders can help states identify and expand common interests in cooperation, executive leadership will facilitate states to overcome operational obstacles in cooperation, such as the `collective action' problem and the `relative gains' concern. The future of institution-building in the Indo-Pacific will depend on whether and how these two leadership roles are played by scholars and states in the region. In the conclusion, we discuss the challenges of institutionalizing the Indo-Pacific and highlight China as a wild card in the future of Indo-Pacific regionalism.},

This article introduces an efficient sequential Monte Carlo algorithm designed for learning unknown changepoints in continuous time. The method is intuitively simple: new changepoints for the latest window of data are proposed by conditioning only on data observed since the most recent estimated changepoint, as these observations carry most of the information about the current state of the process. The proposed method shows improved performance over the current state of the art. Another advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can be made adaptive, varying the number of particles according to the apparent local complexity of the target changepoint probability distribution. This saves valuable computing time when changes in the changepoint distribution are negligible, and enables rebalancing of the importance weights of existing particles when a significant change in the target distribution is encountered. The plain and adaptive versions of the method are illustrated using the canonical continuous time changepoint problem of inferring the intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process, although the method is generally applicable to any changepoint problem. Performance is demonstrated using both conjugate and nonconjugate Bayesian models for the intensity. Appendices to the article are available online, illustrating the method on other models and applications.},

Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10\textendash 30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

Unlike a standard mixture model which assumes that each data point belongs to one and only one mixture component, or cluster, a partial membership model allows data points to have fractional membership in multiple clusters. Algorithms which assign data points partial memberships to clusters can be useful for tasks such as clustering genes based on microarray data (Gasch \& Eisen, 2002). Our Bayesian Partial Membership Model (BPM) uses exponential family distributions to model each cluster, and a product of these distibtutions, with weighted parameters, to model each datapoint. Here the weights correspond to the degree to which the datapoint belongs to each cluster. All parameters in the BPM are continuous, so we can use Hybrid Monte Carlo to perform inference and learning. We discuss relationships between the BPM and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Mixed Membership models, Exponential Family PCA, and fuzzy clustering. Lastly, we show some experimental results and discuss nonparametric extensions to our model.},

This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

  abstract = {This book provides a compact self-contained introduction to the theory and application of Bayesian statistical methods. The book is accessible to readers having a basic familiarity with probability, yet allows more advanced readers to quickly grasp the principles underlying Bayesian theory and methods. The examples and computer code allow the reader to understand and implement basic Bayesian data analyses using standard statistical models and to extend the standard models to specialized data analysis situations. The book begins with fundamental notions such as probability, exchangeability and Bayes' rule, and ends with modern topics such as variable selection in regression, generalized linear mixed effects models, and semiparametric copula estimation. Numerous examples from the social, biological and physical sciences show how to implement these methodologies in practice. Monte Carlo summaries of posterior distributions play an important role in Bayesian data analysis. The open-source R statistical computing environment provides sufficient functionality to make Monte Carlo estimation very easy for a large number of statistical models and example R-code is provided throughout the text. Much of the example code can be run ``as is'' in R, and essentially all of it can be run after downloading the relevant datasets from the companion website for this book. Peter Hoff is an Associate Professor of Statistics and Biostatistics at the University of Washington. He has developed a variety of Bayesian methods for multivariate data, including covariance and copula estimation, cluster analysis, mixture modeling and social network analysis.

It takes the form of a second-order partial differential equation that the elements of any square root of the inverse of the limiting covariance matrix must satisfy. This condition is applied to three examples with the conclusion that no covariance stabilizing transformation exists for the trinomial distribution.

  abstract = {Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) are non-parametric models that can capture complex exogenous variable effects. In any regression problem, it is often of interest to learn which variables are most active. Variable activity in BART is usually measured by counting the number of times a tree splits for each variable. Such one-way counts have the advantage of fast computations. Despite their convenience, one-way counts have several issues. They are statistically unjustified, cannot distinguish between main effects and interaction effects, and become inflated when measuring interaction effects. An alternative method well-established in the literature is Sobol' indices, a variance-based global sensitivity analysis technique. However, these indices often require Monte Carlo integration, which can be computationally expensive. This paper provides analytic expressions for Sobol' indices for BART posterior samples. These expressions are easy to interpret and are computationally feasible. Furthermore, we will show a fascinating connection between first-order (main-effects) Sobol' indices and one-way counts. We also introduce a novel ranking method, and use this to demonstrate that the proposed indices preserve the Sobol'-based rank order of variable importance. Finally, we compare these methods using analytic test functions and the En-ROADS climate impacts simulator.},

The major challenge in implementing a self-starting monitoring scheme is that there exists little or no historical in-control data to accurately estimate in-control process parameters. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian self-starting monitoring scheme to detect on-line whether a process mean has exceeded a pre-determined critical threshold. We assume the process is subject to various types of random drift and random jumps prior to exceeding a critical threshold. In comparison with existing self-starting Bayesian schemes in the literature, our model is more flexible in capturing various types of trends and requires less knowledge of process parameters. In addition, the proposed monitoring scheme is much more computationally efficient, rendering it much more applicable for numerous practical situations where model parameter information is limited and timely detection of a critical event is crucial. Numerical studies based on simulated signals and several real data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare with existing methods in the literature. The proposed method is shown to be less sensitive to parameter misspecification, more flexible in capturing various trends in the data, and much more computationally efficient.},

This paper proposed a log-likelihood-ratio-based non-parametric cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart to monitor arbitrary distribution change and diagnose the detailed change type simultaneously. By integrating the superiority of log-likelihood ratio test to detect any change of distribution and CUSUM chart to detect a small change, the proposed approach can detect small potential changes in location, scale and shape; and provide detailed information about change type when control chart gives a signal. Comparison results with many other non-parametric approaches were provided by numerical simulation and the results of an application case demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Through interviews with elite North Korean defectors and textual analysis of North Korean and international sources, I show that North Korea's nuclear ideology has been constructed according to different frames of meaning, targeting referent actors of international `enemy' powers and domestic audiences. This article concludes that nuclear ideology functions primarily as a tool to arouse domestic legitimacy for the North Korean regime-state, by targeting elite actors within the highly stratified domestic population. From an international perspective, perception of North Korea's survival remains tied largely to the regime-state's physical possession of nuclear weapons. This article has extremely timely theoretical and policy implications given the current `dialogue' between US and North Korean leaders. First, it opens up fruitful avenues of inquiry surrounding questions of the legitimacy of rogue states within international relations. Secondly, this article calls for a more robust understanding of the domestic-level politics of North Korea, in order to understand the regime-state's foreign policy decisions vis-\`a-vis its nuclear programme.},

In this paper, we evaluate the ability of four EWMA-type control charts in detecting increases in the Poisson rate by using the steady-state average run length, which is the most commonly used measure in statistical process control (SPC) or health surveillance. The simulation study shows that for small drift rates, both the one-sided upper EWMA chart (referred as EZ chart) and the adaptive EWMA (AEWMA) chart with large {$\gamma$} value from Huber's score function perform better than the other EWMA-type control charts; for large drift rates, the AEWMA chart with small {$\gamma$} value seems to behave the best amongst the four EWMA-type control charts for detecting Poisson mean drifts.},

Updating the control chart limits during the monitoring period reduces estimation uncertainty. However, when out-of-control situations remain undetected, using the corresponding samples to update the parameter estimates can deteriorate the control chart performance in terms of in-control and out-of-control run lengths. For this reason, updating parameter estimates should only occur when there is sufficient evidence of an in-control process state. In this article, we study the performance of a cautious updating scheme for the Shewhart, Cumulative Sum, and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average control charts. We propose simple rules for updating parameters that improve the out-of-control performance of the control charts. We show the added value of using these updating rules in practice through a case study using data from a truck manufacturer.},

The performance of the functional linear regression model depends on the number of principal components used. We therefore introduce a consistent robust model selection procedure to choose the number of principal components. Our robust functional linear regression model can be used alongside an outlier detection procedure to effectively identify abnormal functional responses. A simulation study shows our method is able to effectively capture the regression behavior in the presence of outliers, and is able to find the outliers with high accuracy. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method on jet engine sensor data.

For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to find a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation.

This book starts with the notion of potential outcomes, each corresponding to the outcome that would be realized if a subject were exposed to a particular treatment or regime. In this approach, causal effects are comparisons of such potential outcomes. The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can only observe one of the potential outcomes for a particular subject. The authors discuss how randomized experiments allow us to assess causal effects and then turn to observational studies. They lay out the assumptions needed for causal inference and describe the leading analysis methods, including matching, propensity-score methods, and instrumental variables.

ABSTRACT Motivated by applications to root-cause identification of faults in multistage manufacturing processes that involve a large number of tools or equipment at each stage, we consider multiple testing in regression models whose outputs represent the quality characteristics of a multistage manufacturing process. Because of the large number of input variables that correspond to the tools or equipments used, this falls in the framework of regression modeling in the modern era of big data. On the other hand, with quick fault detection and diagnosis followed by tool rectification, sparsity can be assumed in the regression model. We introduce a new approach to address the multiple testing problem and demonstrate its advantages over existing methods. We also illustrate its performance in an application to semiconductor wafer fabrication that motivated this development. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Examples of random measures that have this characterization include the Dirichlet process, its two-parameter extension, the two-parameter Poisson\textendash Dirichlet process, finite dimensional Dirichlet priors, and beta two-parameter processes. The rich nature of stick-breaking priors offers Bayesians a useful class of priors for nonparametric problems, while the similar construction used in each prior can be exploited to develop a general computational procedure for fitting them. In this article we present two general types of Gibbs samplers that can be used to fit posteriors of Bayesian hierarchical models based on stick-breaking priors. The first type of Gibbs sampler, referred to as a P\'olya urn Gibbs sampler, is a generalized version of a widely used Gibbs sampling method currently employed for Dirichlet process computing. This method applies to stick-breaking priors with a known P\'olya urn characterization, that is, priors with an explicit and simple prediction rule. Our second method, the blocked Gibbs sampler, is based on an entirely different approach that works by directly sampling values from the posterior of the random measure. The blocked Gibbs sampler can be viewed as a more general approach because it works without requiring an explicit prediction rule. We find that the blocked Gibbs avoids some of the limitations seen with the P\'olya urn approach and should be simpler for nonexperts to use.},

These results provide a better understanding of models and have both theoretical and practical applications. To facilitate the use of our models we generalize the work in Brunner, Chan, James and Lo (2001) by extending their weighted Chinese restaurant (WCR) Monte Carlo procedure, an i.i.d. sequential importance sampling (SIS) procedure for approximating posterior mean functionals based on the Dirichlet process, to the case of approximation of mean functionals and additionally their posterior laws in species sampling mixture models. We also discuss collapsed Gibbs sampling, P\'olya urn Gibbs sampling and a P\'olya urn SIS scheme.

  year = {2009},
  abstract = {The challenge of detecting a change in the distribution of data is a sequential decision problem that is relevant to many engineering solutions, including quality control and machine and process monitoring. This dissertation develops techniques for exact solution of change-detection problems with discrete time and discrete observations. Change-detection problems are classified as Bayes or minimax based on the availability of information on the change-time distribution. A Bayes optimal solution uses prior information about the distribution of the change time to minimize the expected cost, whereas a minimax optimal solution minimizes the cost under the worst-case change-time distribution. Both types of problems are addressed. The most important result of the dissertation is the development of a polynomial-time algorithm for the solution of important classes of Markov Bayes change-detection problems. Existing techniques for epsilon-exact solution of partially observable Markov decision processes have complexity exponential in the number of observation symbols. A new algorithm, called constellation induction, exploits the concavity and Lipschitz continuity of the value function, and has complexity polynomial in the number of observation symbols. It is shown that change-detection problems with a geometric change-time distribution and identically- and independently-distributed observations before and after the change are solvable in polynomial time. Also, change-detection problems on hidden Markov models with a fixed number of recurrent states are solvable in polynomial time. A detailed implementation and analysis of the constellation-induction algorithm are provided. Exact solution methods are also established for several types of minimax change-detection problems. Finite-horizon problems with arbitrary observation distributions are modeled as extensive-form games and solved using linear programs. Infinite-horizon problems with linear penalty for detection delay and identically- and independently-distributed observations can be solved in polynomial time via epsilon-optimal parameterization of a cumulative-sum procedure. Finally, the properties of policies for change-detection problems are described and analyzed. Simple classes of formal languages are shown to be sufficient for epsilon-exact solution of change-detection problems, and methods for finding minimally sized policy representations are described.},

In such circumstances, it is convenient to use a graphical model to represent the statistical dependencies, via a set of connected "modules", each relating to a specific data modality, and drawing on specific domain expertise in their development. In principle, given data, the conventional statistical update then allows for coherent uncertainty quantification and information propagation through and across the modules. However, misspecification of any module can contaminate the estimate and update of others, often in unpredictable ways. In various settings, particularly when certain modules are trusted more than others, practitioners have preferred to avoid learning with the full model in favor of approaches that restrict the information propagation between modules, for example by restricting propagation to only particular directions along the edges of the graph. In this article, we investigate why these modular approaches might be preferable to the full model in misspecified settings. We propose principled criteria to choose between modular and full-model approaches. The question arises in many applied settings, including large stochastic dynamical systems, meta-analysis, epidemiological models, air pollution models, pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics, and causal inference with propensity scores.},

  abstract = {Performance measures of control charts with estimated parameters are random variables and vary significantly across reference samples. In this context, a recent idea has been to study the distribution of the realized (or conditional) in-control average run length (CARL0) [or, equivalently, the conditional false-alarm rate (CFAR)] for a set of estimates from a given reference sample and apply the exceedance probability criterion (EPC) to design control charts that ensure a desirable in-control performance. Under the EPC, the probability that the CARL0 (or the CFAR) is at least (or at most) equal to a specified value is guaranteed with a high probability, which helps prevent low in-control ARL's (or high false-alarm rates) from occurring. In order to apply the EPC, the c.d.f. of the CARL0 (or the CFAR) is necessary. For the two-sided Shewhart Xbar control chart, under normality, we derive the exact c.d.f. of the CARL0 and the CFAR, currently not available in the literature. Using these key results, we calculate the minimum number of Phase I samples required to guarantee a desired in-control performance in terms of the EPC. Since the required amount of data can be prohibitively large, we also provide exact formulas for adjustments to the control limits for a given amount of Phase I data; some tables are provided. Our adjustment formulas give more accurate results compared to some available methods. The impact of these adjustments on the out-of-control performance of the chart is examined in detail. A summary and some recommendations are provided.},

  abstract = {Control charts are powerful tools used to monitor the quality of processes. In practice, control chart limits are often calculated using parameter estimates from an in-control Phase I reference sample. In Phase II of the monitoring scheme, statistics based on new samples are compared with the estimated control limits to monitor for departures from the in-control state. Many studies that evaluate control chart performance in Phase II rely on the assumption that the in-control parameters are known. Although the additional variability introduced into the monitoring scheme through parameter estimation is known to affect the chart performance, many studies do not consider the effect of estimation on the performance of the chart. This paper contains a review of the literature that explicitly considers the effect of parameter estimation on control chart properties. Some recommendations are made and future research ideas in this area are provided.},

The most frequently used type of Bayesian graphical models are Bayesian networks. The structural part of a Bayesian graphical model is a graph consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes represent variables, which may be either discrete or continuous. An edge between two nodes A and B indicates a direct influence between the state of A and the state of B, which in some domains can also be interpreted as a causal relation. The widespread use of Bayesian networks is largely due to the availability of efficient inference algorithms for answering probabilistic queries about the states of the variables in the network. Furthermore, to support the construction of Bayesian network models, learning algorithms are also available. We give an overview of the Bayesian network formalism and some of the algorithmic developments in the area.},

  abstract = {This article presents an exposition and synthesis of the theory and some applications of the so-called indirect method of inference. These ideas have been exploited in the field of econometrics, but less so in other fields such as biostatistics and epidemiology. In the indirect method, statistical inference is based on an intermediate statistic, which typically follows an asymptotic normal distribution, but is not necessarily a consistent estimator of the parameter of interest. This intermediate statistic can be a naive estimator based on a convenient but misspecified model, a sample moment or a solution to an estimating equation. We review a procedure of indirect inference based on the generalized method of moments, which involves adjusting the naive estimator to be consistent and asymptotically normal. The objective function of this procedure is shown to be interpretable as an ``indirect likelihood'' based on the intermediate statistic. Many properties of the ordinary likelihood function can be extended to this indirect likelihood. This method is often more convenient computationally than maximum likelihood estimation when handling such model complexities as random effects and measurement error, for example, and it can also serve as a basis for robust inference and model selection, with less stringent assumptions on the data generating mechanism. Many familiar estimation techniques can be viewed as examples of this approach. We describe applications to measurement error, omitted covariates and recurrent events. A dataset concerning prevention of mammary tumors in rats is analyzed using a Poisson regression model with overdispersion. A second dataset from an epidemiological study is analyzed using a logistic regression model with mismeasured covariates. A third dataset of exam scores is used to illustrate robust covariance selection in graphical models.},

By combining the exchange random order distribution induced from the Poisson\textendash Dirichlet process and nonlocal priors, BHM exhibits satisfactory performance for mean-shift detection with multivariate sequences under different error distributions. In particular, BHM yields the smallest detection error compared with other competitive methods considered in the article. We use a local scan procedure to accelerate the computation, while the anomaly locations are determined by maximizing the posterior probability through dynamic programming. We establish consistency of the estimated number and locations of the change points and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the BHM approach. Among the popular change point detection algorithms, BHM yields the best performance for most of the datasets in terms of the F1 score for the wind turbine anomaly detection.},

A/B tests are typically analyzed via frequentist p-values and confidence intervals; but these inferences are wholly unreliable if users endogenously choose samples sizes by *continuously monitoring* their tests. We define *always valid* p-values and confidence intervals that let users try to take advantage of data as fast as it becomes available, providing valid statistical inference whenever they make their decision. Always valid inference can be interpreted as a natural interface for a sequential hypothesis test, which empowers users to implement a modified test tailored to them. In particular, we show in an appropriate sense that the measures we develop tradeoff sample size and power efficiently, despite a lack of prior knowledge of the user's relative preference between these two goals. We also use always valid p-values to obtain multiple hypothesis testing control in the sequential context.

Many Phase I control charts are based on an implicit assumption of normally distributed process observations. In the beginning stages of process control, little information is available about the process and the normality assumption may not be reasonable. Existing robust and distribution-free control charts are concerned with the establishment of Phase II control limits that are robust to nonnormality or outliers from the Phase I sample. Our literature review revealed no purely distribution-free Phase I control-chart methods. We propose a distribution-free method for defining the in-control state of a process and identifying an in-control reference sample. The resultant reference sample can be used to estimate the process parameters for the Phase II procedure of choice. The proposed rank-based method is compared with the traditional X chart using Monte Carlo simulation. The rank-based method compares favorably to the X chart when the process is normally distributed and performs better than the X chart in many situations when the process distribution is skewed or heavy tailed.},

The performance of a generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) control chart is evaluated, where the likelihood ratio is based on a moving window of past observations. The performance of the GLR chart is compared with the performance of other options, such as combinations of Shewhart and cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts and an adaptive CUSUM chart, that have been proposed for detecting a wide range of shift sizes. Performance is evaluated for sustained shifts, transient shifts, and drifts in the mean. It is shown that the overall performance of the GLR chart is at least as good as these other options. These other options have multiple control-chart parameters that allow for the charts to be tuned to be more sensitive to certain shifts that may be of interest. However, the GLR chart does not require users to specify the values of any control-chart parameters other than the size of the window and the control limit. We recommend a specific window size and provide a table of control limits corresponding to specified values of the false-alarm rate, so it is very easy to design the GLR chart for use in applications. Simulating the performance of the GLR chart is time consuming, but approximating the GLR chart with a set of CUSUM charts provides a much faster way of evaluating the performance of the GLR chart for research purposes.},

While acknowledging the importance of all these dimensions, this article draws attention to a largely neglected feature of China's counterterrorism strategy: the Chinese party-state's social engineering of Xinjiang. Building on Maoist-era practices such as the mass line and the `friend vs. enemy' binary, the Communist party under Xi Jinping has integrated surveillance technologies as part of its strategy of preventive counterterrorism and `de-extremization'. This article argues that the Chinese party-state's embrace of modern technologies, a weak liberal tradition in China, Xi Jinping's rise to power in late 2012, and the appointment of Chen Quanguo as Xinjiang's party-secretary in 2016, provides the socio-political background for the intensification of securitization, surveillance and introduction of `re-education and training centres' in Xinjiang. Surveillance technologies now complement collective, face-to-face methods of surveillance and Maoist-era techniques of mass mobilization, enabling the Chinese party-state to govern and manage the biopolitical spaces of Uyghurs with greater intensity, according to the state's precise norms. The legalization and institutionalization of `de-extremization' has also led to the shift from mass `de-extremization' propaganda to `drip-irrigation' ideological and political re-education of individuals deemed at risk of extremism. The result is an increased capacity by the Chinese party-state to surveil and control the region, and to more effectively negate the possibility of individual resistance.},

  abstract = {Stochastic blockmodels have been proposed as a tool for detecting community structure in networks as well as for generating synthetic networks for use as benchmarks. Most blockmodels, however, ignore variation in vertex degree, making them unsuitable for applications to real-world networks, which typically display broad degree distributions that can significantly distort the results. Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for community detection using this objective function or its non-degree-corrected counterpart and show that the degree-corrected version dramatically outperforms the uncorrected one in both real-world and synthetic networks.},

  abstract = {An unsupervised CPD ensemble (CPDE) procedure with the pseudocode of the particular proposed ensemble algorithms and the link to their Python realization is proposed, showing that the proposed CPDE outperforms non-ensemble CPD procedures. Offline changepoint detection (CPD) algorithms are used for signal segmentation in an optimal way. Generally, these algorithms are based on the assumption that signal's changed statistical properties are known, and the appropriate models (metrics, cost functions) for changepoint detection are used. Otherwise, the process of proper model selection can become laborious and time-consuming with uncertain results. Although an ensemble approach is well known for increasing the robustness of the individual algorithms and dealing with mentioned challenges, it is weakly formalized and much less highlighted for CPD problems than for outlier detection or classification problems. This paper proposes an unsupervised CPD ensemble (CPDE) procedure with the pseudocode of the particular proposed ensemble algorithms and the link to their Python realization. The approach's novelty is in aggregating several cost functions before the changepoint search procedure running during the offline analysis. The numerical experiment showed that the proposed CPDE outperforms non-ensemble CPD procedures. Additionally, we focused on analyzing common CPD algorithms, scaling, and aggregation functions, comparing them during the numerical experiment. The results were obtained on the two anomaly benchmarks that contain industrial faults and failures\textemdash Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) and Skoltech Anomaly Benchmark (SKAB). One of the possible applications of our research is the estimation of the failure time for fault identification and isolation problems of the technical diagnostics.},

For the goal of estimating average treatment effects, we propose to fit a model allowing treatment to interact with background variables and then average over the distribution of these variables in the population. This can be seen as an extension of multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP), a method used in political science and other areas of survey research, where researchers wish to generalize from a sparse and possibly non-representative sample to the general population. In this paper, we discuss areas where this method can be used in the psychological sciences. We use our method to estimate the norming distribution for the Big Five Personality Scale using open source data. We argue that large open data sources like this and other collaborative data sources can be combined with MRP to help resolve current challenges of generalizability and replication in psychology.},

However, it has been forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a much more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time axis. Because of this flexibility, DTW is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately, however, DTW does not obey the triangular inequality and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on speeding up sequential searches. In this work, we introduce a novel technique for the exact indexing of DTW. We prove that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.},

  abstract = {The multivariate Hotelling's T2 control chart is designed to be used in a mass production for processes where data to estimate the mean vector and covariance matrix as well as the computation of control limits are available before a production run. Recent years have seen a trend in manufacturing industries to produce smaller lot sizes, a.k.a., low volume production which is a result of increased importance given to just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing techniques, synchronous manufacturing and the reduction of in-process inventory and costs. This new manufacturing environment is also referred to as short runs production or short runs. In a short runs environment, it is difficult or perhaps impossible to establish a reliable historical data set in setting valid control limits and in estimating process parameters due to the availability of insufficient data for a particular process because production runs are usually short and change frequently from one process to another. There is also a need to start charting at or very near the beginning of the run in such a case. Another problem encountered in a short runs production such as in job shops is that there are many different types of measurements so that many different control charts are needed. Standardized control charts that allow different statistics to be plotted on the same chart are extremely useful in short runs. Control charts with standard scale simplify the control charting process in a short runs environment. In this paper, we address the multivariate short runs problems for process dispersion based on individual measurements by presenting the required formulas so that the chart can be used from the start of production, whether or not prior information for estimating the chart's limit and its parameter is available. The proposed chart plots standardized statistics for multiple parts on the same chart. This paper extends the work of the authors in Ref. 13.},

  abstract = {A new penalized likelihood-based approach via norm regularization is proposed, which does not select variables but rather ``shrinks'' all process mean estimates toward zero, which makes the proposed chart significantly efficient to monitor high-dimensional processes. Abstract Technological advances have resulted in the introduction of new products and manufacturing processes that have a large number of characteristics and variables to be monitored to ensure the product quality. Simultaneous monitoring of variables under such a high-dimensional environment is quite challenging. Traditional approaches are less sensitive to the out-of-control signals in high-dimensional processes, especially when only a few variables are responsible for abnormal changes in the process output. Recently, variable selection-based charts are proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the traditional approaches. These approaches adopt diagnosis procedures to identify a small subset of potentially changed variables. However, the detection capability of these charts may be low in cases when the size of the shift is relatively small in a highly correlated data structure, which is critical in modern industry. Moreover, the complexity of computation would dramatically increase as the dimension of the process parameters increases due to the diagnosis procedure, which is inappropriate for online monitoring. This article proposes a new penalized likelihood-based approach via norm regularization, which does not select variables but rather ``shrinks'' all process mean estimates toward zero. A closed-form solution of the proposed approach along with probability distributions of the monitoring statistic under null and alternative hypotheses are obtained, which makes the proposed chart significantly efficient to monitor high-dimensional processes. In addition, we explore theoretical properties of the approach and present several extensions of the proposed chart and its integration with other existing charts. Finally, we compare the performance of the approach with existing methods and present a case study of a high-speed milling process.},

Moreover, they provide statistical inference in a straightforward manner as well as a natural mechanism to deal with the ``large p, small n'' and sparsity problems through Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures. Using simulations, the authors find that for a variety of data-generating processes, the proposed BSCMs almost always provide better predictive accuracy and parameter precision than extant SCMs. They demonstrate an application of the proposed BSCMs to a real-world context of a tax imposed on soda sales in Washington state in 2010. As in the simulations, the proposed models outperform extant models, as measured by predictive accuracy in the posttreatment periods. The authors find that the tax led to an increase of 5.7\% in retail price and a decrease of 5.5\%{$\sim$}5.8\% in sales. They also find that retailers in Washington overshifted the tax to consumers, leading to a pass-through rate of approximately 121\%.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Using steady-state run-length analysis in combination with the conditional expected delay (CED) metric, we show that the increasingly discussed progressive mean (PM) and homogeneously weighted moving average (HWMA) control charts should not be used in practice. Previously reported performance of methods based on these two approaches is misleading, as we found that performance is good only when a process change occurs at the very start of monitoring. Traditional alternatives, such as exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts, not only have more consistent detection behavior over a range of different change points, they can also lead to better out-of-control zero-state ARL performance when properly designed.},

Essentially, the ARL counts the number of observations until the corresponding procedure flags a change. To enable a fair comparison between competing designs, one frequently deploys the steady-state ARL. Differing from the older concept of the zero-state ARL (which assumes that the to-be-detected change occurs immediately at startup or never), the former measure postulates this change's appearance after reaching some steady state. Considering different notions (primarily conditional and cyclical ones) of the measure, we recapitulate its historical development; provide a critical discussion of its often-careless exploitation, including a few misconceptions; and derive some new mathematical characterizations that permit its easy calculation.},

Later in life Kolmogorov changed his research interests to the area of turbulence, where his publications beginning in 1941 had a significant influence on the field. In classical mechanics, he is best known for the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem. In 1957 he solved a particular interpretation of Hilbert's thirteenth problem (a joint work with his student V. I. Arnold). He was a founder of algorithmic complexity theory, often referred to as Kolmogorov complexity theory, which he began to develop around this time.

Recently, Thompson sampling (TS), a randomized algorithm with a Bayesian spirit, has attracted much attention for its empirically excellent performance, and it is revealed to have an optimal regret bound in the standard single-play MAB problem. In this paper, we propose the multiple-play Thompson sampling (MP-TS) algorithm, an extension of TS to the multiple-play MAB problem, and discuss its regret analysis. We prove that MP-TS for binary rewards has the optimal regret upper bound that matches the regret lower bound provided by Anantharam et al. (1987). Therefore, MP-TS is the first computationally efficient algorithm with optimal regret. A set of computer simulations was also conducted, which compared MP-TS with state-of-the-art algorithms. We also propose a modification of MP-TS, which is shown to have better empirical performance.},

This study presents two new proposals of self-start statistical process control procedures for implementing quality control charts in mass customized production environments. Mass customization is characterized by high variety and/or low production volumes, or by current production strategies that increase the necessity of flexibility. The proposed approaches consider that the quality characteristic under monitoring is the same among the items, allowing the possibility of different averages and standard deviations for different products into the series. Analysis of the proposed approaches include assumption violations and the comparison of the new approaches to a Phase I-Phase II residual control chart, as benchmark. Simulation results show that one of the proposed approaches ties in performance with the benchmark, and the other can produce faster detection of deviations from the process mean, both without the need of a Phase I - retrospective analysis, thus increasing suitability for application in real environments. Also, the proposed approaches are made to handle with unitary production lots as well. Analysis performed in an extensive simulation procedure presents that normality assumption violation (with higher asymmetry) has the most degenerative effect on all tested control charts. The study also shown decreasing in performance on scenarios that violated the independence of the observations assumption.},

The data-generating process is defined by Simultaneously Transforming and Rounding (STAR) a continuous-valued process, which produces a flexible family of integer-valued distributions capable of modeling zero-inflation, bounded or censored data, and over- or underdispersion. The transformation is modeled as unknown for greater distributional flexibility, while the rounding operation ensures a coherent integer-valued data-generating process. An efficient MCMC algorithm is developed for posterior inference and provides a mechanism for adaptation of successful Bayesian models and algorithms for continuous data to the integer-valued data setting. Using the STAR framework, we design a new Bayesian Additive Regression Tree model for integer-valued data, which demonstrates impressive predictive distribution accuracy for both synthetic data and a large healthcare utilization dataset. For interpretable regression-based inference, we develop a STAR additive model, which offers greater flexibility and scalability than existing integer-valued models. The STAR additive model is applied to study the recent decline in Amazon river dolphins.},

We reformulate the task to find the best classifier as an optimization problem and solve it by regularization techniques, namely the conjugate gradient method with early stopping, the principal component method and the ridge method. We study the empirical version with finite training samples consisting of incomplete functions observed on different subsets of the domain and show that the optimal, possibly zero, misclassification probability can be achieved in the limit along a possibly non-convergent empirical regularization path. Being able to work with fragmentary training data we propose a domain extension and selection procedure that finds the best domain beyond the common observation domain of all curves. In a simulation study we compare the different regularization methods and investigate the performance of domain selection. Our methodology is illustrated on a medical data set, where we observe a substantial improvement of classification accuracy due to domain extension.},

A conservative remedy to the problem was proposed by Berk et al. (Ann. Statist. 41 (2013) 802\textendash 837) and further extended by Bachoc, Preinerstorfer and Steinberger (2016). These proposals, labeled ``PoSI methods,'' provide valid inference after arbitrary model selection. They are computationally NP-hard and have limitations in their theoretical justifications. We therefore propose computationally efficient confidence regions, named ``UPoSI' (``U'' is for ``uniform'' or ``universal.'') and prove large-\$p\$ asymptotics for them. We do this for linear OLS regression allowing misspecification of the normal linear model, for both fixed and random covariates, and for independent as well as some types of dependent data. We start by proving a general equivalence result for the post-selection inference problem and a simultaneous inference problem in a setting that strips inessential features still present in a related result of Berk et al. (Ann. Statist. 41 (2013) 802\textendash 837). We then construct valid PoSI confidence regions that are the first to have vastly improved computational efficiency in that the required computation times grow only quadratically rather than exponentially with the total number \$p\$ of covariates. These are also the first PoSI confidence regions with guaranteed asymptotic validity when the total number of covariates \$p\$ diverges (almost exponentially) with the sample size \$n\$. Under standard tail assumptions, we only require \$(\textbackslash log p)\^\{7\}=o(n)\$ and \$k=o(\textbackslash sqrt\{n/\textbackslash log p\})\$ where \$k\$ (\$\textbackslash le p\$) is the largest number of covariates (model size) considered for selection. We study various properties of these confidence regions, including their Lebesgue measures, and compare them theoretically with those proposed previously.},

He is a professor in the field of operations research, and his daily activities involve building models of mathematical optimization, developing algorithms for solving the problems, implementing those algorithms using computer programming languages, experimenting with data, etc. Three languages are involved: human language, mathematical language, and computer language. His team of students need to go over three different languages, which requires "translation" among the three languages. As this book was written to teach his research group how to translate, this book will also be useful for anyone who needs to learn how to translate in a similar situation.The Julia Language is as fast as C, as convenient as MATLAB, and as general as Python with a flexible algebraic modeling language for mathematical optimization problems. With the great support from Julia developers, especially the developers of the JuMP\textemdash Julia for Mathematical Programming\textemdash package, Julia makes a perfect tool for students and professionals in operations research and related areas such as industrial engineering, management science, transportation engineering, economics, and regional science.For more information, visit: http://www.chkwon.net/julia},

By making use of generalized likelihood ratio martingales, confidence sequences are constructed for the unknown parameters of the binomial, Poisson, uniform, gamma and other distributions. It is proved that for the exponential family of distributions, the method of using generalized likelihood ratio martingales leads to a sequence of intervals which have the desirable property of eventually shrinking to the population parameter. The problem of nuisance parameters is considered, and in this connection, boundary crossing probabilities are obtained for the sequence of Student's \$t\$-statistics, and a limit theorem relating to the boundary crossing probabilities for the Wiener process is proved.},

  abstract = {Animals, humans, and organizations are known to adjust how (much) they explore complex environments that exceed their information processing capacity, rather than relentlessly search for the optimal action. The adjusted depth of exploration is supposed to depend on the aspiration level internal to the agent. This action selection tendency is known as satisficing. The Risk-sensitive Satisficing (RS) model implements satisficing in the reinforcement learning framework through conversion of action values into gains (or losses) relative to the aspiration level. The risk-sensitive evaluation of action values by RS has been shown to be effective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, first we analyze RS in comparison with UCB and Thompson sampling algorithms. We also show that RS shows differential risk-attitudes considering the risks. Then we propose the Softsatisficing policy that is a stochastic equivalent of RS and further analyze the exploratory behavior of risk-sensitive satisficing that RS and Softsatisficing implement. We emphasize that Softsatisficing has the potential of modeling risk-sensitive foraging and other decision-making behaviors by humans, animals, and organizations. In reinforcement learning (RL), the intrinsic reward estimation is necessary for policy learning when the extrinsic reward is sparse or absent. To this end, Unified Curiosity-driven Learning with Smoothed intrinsic reward Estimation (UCLSE) is proposed to address the sparse extrinsic reward problem from the perspective of completeness of intrinsic reward estimation. We further propose state distribution-aware weighting method and policy-aware weighting method to dynamically unify two mainstream intrinsic reward estimation methods. In this way, the agent can explore the environment more effectively and efficiently. Under this framework, we propose to employ an attention module to extract task-relevant features for a more precise estimation of intrinsic reward. Moreover, we propose to improve the robustness of policy learning by smoothing the intrinsic reward with a batch of transitions close to the current transition. Extensive experimental results on Atari games demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both score and training efficiency.},

We propose an accurate, fast, and scalable approach to multiple imputation, which we call MIDAS (Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoders). MIDAS employs a class of unsupervised neural networks known as denoising autoencoders, which are designed to reduce dimensionality by corrupting and attempting to reconstruct a subset of data. We repurpose denoising autoencoders for multiple imputation by treating missing values as an additional portion of corrupted data and drawing imputations from a model trained to minimize the reconstruction error on the originally observed portion. Systematic tests on simulated as well as real social science data, together with an applied example involving a large-scale electoral survey, illustrate MIDAS's accuracy and efficiency across a range of settings. We provide open-source software for implementing MIDAS.},

Besides numerous applications in statistics, optimization, and imaging, the MM principle finds wide applications in large scale machine learning problems such as matrix completion, discriminant analysis, and nonnegative matrix factorizations. When applied to nonconvex optimization problems, MM algorithms enjoy the advantages of convexifying the objective function, separating variables, numerical stability, and ease of implementation. However, compared to the large body of literature on other optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of MM algorithms is scattered and problem specific. This survey presents a unified treatment of the convergence of MM algorithms. With modern applications in mind, the results encompass non-smooth objective functions and non-asymptotic analysis.},

Such theorems are false for Dirichlet processes. Models are constructed combining partially specified Polya trees with other information such as monotonicity or unimodality. It is shown how to compute bounds on posterior expectations over the class of all priors with the given specifications. A numerical example is given. A theorem of Diaconis and Freedman about Dirichlet processes is generalized to Polya trees, allowing Polya trees to be the models for errors in regression problems. Finally, empirical Bayes models using Dirichlet processes are generalized to Polya trees. An example from Berry and Christensen is reanalyzed with a Polya tree model.},

This is especially important with short-run processes where the measurements have high dimensionality. This article proposes a chart that allows monitoring with the second observation regardless of the dimensionality and reduces the average run length in detecting early shifts in high-dimensionality measurements. The proposed control chart can start monitoring quite early before considerable reference data are collected during the initial stage of production. A change point estimate is also available from our procedure, which is shown consistent for locating the correct change point. Both simulation results and an industry example show the effectiveness of the proposed control chart for monitoring short-run processes with high dimensionality.},

Shifts in one or a few components of process mean vectors, called sparse shifts, are monitored in many applications. To monitor sparse shifts, several control charts have recently been proposed based on the variable selection technique. These charts assume either that the in-control (IC) distribution is completely known or that a sufficiently large reference dataset is available. However, this assumption is not always valid in practice. This paper develops a self-starting control chart that integrates a multivariate spatial rank test with the EWMA charting scheme based on forward variable selection for monitoring sparse mean shifts. Both the theoretical and numerical results show that the proposed chart is robust to non-normally distributed data, fast to compute, easy to construct, and can efficiently detect sparse shifts, especially when the process distribution is heavy-tailed or skewed. The proposed control chart does not need prior knowledge of the IC distribution and can start monitoring even before considerable reference data have been collected. A real-data example from a white wine production process illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed control chart.},

  abstract = {Advanced computing and data acquisition technologies have made possible the collection of high-dimensional data streams in many fields. Efficient online monitoring tools that can correctly identify any abnormal data stream for such data are highly sought. However, most of the existing monitoring procedures directly apply the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure to the data at each time point, and the FDR at each time point (the pointwise FDR) is either specified by users or determined by the in-control (IC) average run length (ARL). If the pointwise FDR is specified by users, the resulting procedure lacks control of the global FDR and keeps users in the dark in terms of the IC ARL. If the pointwise FDR is determined by the IC ARL, the resulting procedure does not give users the flexibility to choose the number of false alarms (Type-I errors) they can tolerate when identifying abnormal data streams, which often makes the procedure too conservative. To address those limitations, a two-stage monitoring procedure is proposed to control both the IC-ARL and Type-I errors at the levels specified by users. As a result, the proposed procedure allows users to choose not only how often they expect any false alarms when all data streams are IC but also how many false alarms they can tolerate when identifying abnormal data streams.

  abstract = {The emerging field of cancer radiomics endeavors to characterize intrinsic patterns of tumor phenotypes and surrogate markers of response by transforming medical images into objects that yield quantifiable summary statistics to which regression and machine learning algorithms may be applied for statistical interrogation. Recent literature has identified clinicopathological association based on textural features deriving from gray-level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) which facilitate evaluations of gray-level spatial dependence within a delineated region of interest. GLCM-derived features, however, tend to contribute highly redundant information. Moreover, when reporting selected feature sets, investigators often fail to adjust for multiplicities and commonly fail to convey the predictive power of their findings. This article presents a Bayesian probabilistic modeling framework for the GLCM as a multivariate object as well as describes its application within a cancer detection context based on computed tomography. The methodology, which circumvents processing steps and avoids evaluations of reductive and highly correlated feature sets, uses latent Gaussian Markov random field structure to characterize spatial dependencies among GLCM cells and facilitates classification via predictive probability. Correctly predicting the underlying pathology of 81\% of the adrenal lesions in our case study, the proposed method outperformed current practices which achieved a maximum accuracy of only 59\%. Simulations and theory are presented to further elucidate this comparison as well as ascertain the utility of applying multivariate Gaussian spatial processes to GLCM objects.},

  abstract = {Cancer radiomics is an emerging discipline promising to elucidate lesion phenotypes and tumor heterogeneity through patterns of enhancement, texture, morphology, and shape. The prevailing technique for image texture analysis relies on the construction and synthesis of Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM). Practice currently reduces the structured count data of a GLCM to reductive and redundant summary statistics for which analysis requires variable selection and multiple comparisons for each application, thus limiting reproducibility. In this article, we develop a Bayesian multivariate probabilistic framework for the analysis and unsupervised clustering of a sample of GLCM objects. By appropriately accounting for skewness and zero-inflation of the observed counts and simultaneously adjusting for existing spatial autocorrelation at nearby cells, the methodology facilitates estimation of texture pattern distributions within the GLCM lattice itself. The techniques are applied to cluster images of adrenal lesions obtained from CT scans with and without administration of contrast. We further assess whether the resultant subtypes are clinically oriented by investigating their correspondence with pathological diagnoses. Additionally, we compare performance to a class of machine-learning approaches currently used in cancer radiomics with simulation studies.},

Abstract Monitoring complex systems involving high-dimensional data streams (HDS) provides quick real-time detection of abnormal changes of system performance, but accurate and efficient diagnosis of the streams responsible has also become increasingly important in many data-rich statistical process control applications. Existing diagnostic procedures, designed for low/moderate dimensional multivariate process, may miss too much important information in the out-of-control streams with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or waste too many resources finding useless in-control streams with a low SNR. In addition, these procedures do not differentiate between streams according to their severity. In this article, we formulate the diagnosis problem of HDS as a multiple testing problem and provide a computationally fast diagnostic procedure to control the weighted missed discovery rate (wMDR) at some satisfactory level. The proposed procedure overcomes the limitations of conventional diagnostic procedures by controlling the wMDR and minimizing the expected number of false positives as well. We show theoretically that the proposed procedure is asymptotically valid and optimal in a certain sense. Simulation studies and a real data analysis from a semiconductor manufacturing process show that the proposed procedure works very well in practice.},

While multivariate statistical process control (SPC) has been receiving increasing attention, existing methods are often inadequate as they are sensitive to the parametric model assumptions of multivariate data. In this paper, we propose a novel, nonparametric k-nearest neighbours empirical cumulative sum (KNN-ECUSUM) control chart that is a machine-learning-based black-box control chart for monitoring multivariate data by utilising extensive historical data under both in-control and out-of-control scenarios. Our proposed method utilises the k-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm for dimension reduction to transform multivariate data into univariate data and then applies the CUSUM procedure to monitor the change on the empirical distribution of the transformed univariate data. Extensive simulation studies and a real industrial example based on a disk monitoring system demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract = {Landslides are severe geographical activities that result in large quantities of rock and debris flowing down hill-slopes, leading to thousands of casualties and billions of dollars in infrastructure damage every year worldwide. For detecting landslides, on-site sensor systems are widely applied for data collection and many existing statistical process control methods can be adopted for modeling and monitoring. However, the conventional methods may perform poorly or even inapplicable when the sensors have different set-up times and end times, especially when the system includes newly deployed sensors with limited data collected. To make effective use of such new sensors immediately after deployment, we propose a novel multi-sensor based charting scheme for dynamic landslide modeling and monitoring by using transfer learning. A regularized parameter-based transfer learning approach integrated with the ordered LASSO is first proposed to effectively transfer information from old sensors with sufficient historical data to new ones with limited data. The approach considers the similarities not only between the autoregressive coefficients of different sensors, but also between the temporal correlation patterns. A control chart is then proposed for monitoring the newly deployed sensors sequentially based on the generalized likelihood ratio. Extensive simulation results and a real data example of landslide monitoring demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

In this paper, we develop a new cautious parameter learning scheme that can distinguish IC observations from out-of-control (OC) observations in the Phase II sample more effectively than Capizzi and Masarotto's scheme. As a result, our cautious parameter learning scheme can provide better estimation of the IC mean and variance. Combining the new cautious parameter learning scheme with an adaptive CUSUM chart, our proposed monitoring procedure is easy to implement, and is shown to have less variability in conditional ARLs and better overall performance for detecting different mean shifts than existing methods.},

The article argues that, in addition to examining the impact of the regional organization itself, one must examine how the existence of these regional organizations changes the strategy of autocratic leading states, which\textemdash in bilateral relations with other countries\textemdash could become more eager to support authoritarian regimes of geopolitical importance. We use the case of the Eurasian Economic Union to explore various strategies of Russia, the leading state, vis-\`a-vis post-Soviet Eurasian countries. These strategies, however, appear only to matter for authoritarian consolidation when countries, from the Russian point of view, are on the `front line' of geopolitical competition with the EU, and which are, therefore, important in stabilizing Russian influence. The article identifies five strategic foreign policy models of leading states which are determined by the existence of regional organizations and evaluates the benefits of these strategies for both leading and targeted states.},

A standard fMRI study gives rise to massive amounts of noisy data with a complicated spatio-temporal correlation structure.

In this paper we discuss the analysis of fMRI data, from the initial acquisition of the raw data to its use in locating brain activity, making inference about brain connectivity and predictions about psychological or disease states.

We show that these issues can be overcome by instead considering sparsity inducing soft decision trees in which the decisions are treated as probabilistic. We implement this in the context of the Bayesian additive regression trees framework and illustrate its promising performance through testing on benchmark data sets. We provide strong theoretical support for our methodology by showing that the posterior distribution concentrates at the minimax rate (up to a logarithmic factor) for sparse functions and functions with additive structures in the high dimensional regime where the dimensionality of the covariate space is allowed to grow nearly exponentially in the sample size. Our method also adapts to the unknown smoothness and sparsity levels, and can be implemented by making minimal modifications to existing Bayesian additive regression tree algorithms.},

  abstract = {Post-stratification is a common technique in survey analysis for incorporating population distributions of variables into survey estimates. The basic technique divides the sample into post-strata, and computes a post-stratification weight w ih = rP h /r h for each sample case in post-stratum h, where r h is the number of survey respondents in post-stratum h, P h is the population proportion from a census, and r is the respondent sample size. Survey estimates, such as functions of means and totals, then weight cases by w h . Variants and extensions of the method include truncation of the weights to avoid excessive variability and raking to a set of two or more univariate marginal distributions. Literature on post-stratification is limited and has mainly taken the randomization (or design-based) perspective, where inference is based on the sampling distribution with population values held fixed. This article develops Bayesian model-based theory for the method. A basic normal post-stratification model is introduced which yields the post-stratified mean as the posterior mean, and a posterior variance that incorporates adjustments for estimating variances. Modifications are then proposed for small sample inference, based on (a) changing the Jeffreys prior for the post-stratum parameters to borrow strength across post-strata, and (b) ignoring partial information about the post-strata. In particular, practical rules for collapsing post-strata to reduce posterior variance are developed and compared with frequentist approaches. Methods for two post-stratifying variables are also considered. Raking sample counts and respondent counts is shown to provide approximate Bayesian inferences when the margins of the two post-stratifiers are available but their joint distribution is not. When the joint distribution is available, raking effectively ignores the information it contains, and hence can be compared with other techniques that ignore information such as collapsing.

  abstract = {An up-to-date, comprehensive treatment of a classic text on missing data in statisticsThe topic of missing data has gained considerable attention in recent decades. This new edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers an up-to-date account of practical methodology for handling missing data problems. Blending theory and application, authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing data mechanism, and then they apply the theory to a wide range of important missing data problems.Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition starts by introducing readers to the subject and approaches toward solving it. It looks at the patterns and mechanisms that create the missing data, as well as a taxonomy of missing data. It then goes on to examine missing data in experiments, before discussing complete-case and available-case analysis, including weighting methods. The new edition expands its coverage to include recent work on topics such as nonresponse in sample surveys, causal inference, diagnostic methods, and sensitivity analysis, among a host of other topics.  An updated ``classic'' written by renowned authorities on the subject Features over 150 exercises (including many new ones) Covers recent work on important methods like multiple imputation, robust alternatives to weighting, and Bayesian methods Revises previous topics based on past student feedback and class experience Contains an updated and expanded bibliography  The authors were awarded The Karl Pearson Prize in 2017 by the International Statistical Institute, for a research contribution that has had profound influence on statistical theory, methodology or applications. Their work "has been no less than defining and transforming." (ISI)Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition is an ideal textbook for upper undergraduate and/or beginning graduate level students of the subject. It is also an excellent source of information for applied statisticians and practitioners in government and industry.},

At each time, each player chooses one arm to play without exchanging information with other players. Players choosing the same arm collide, and, depending on the collision model, either no one receives reward or the colliding players share the reward in an arbitrary way. We show that the minimum system regret of the decentralized MAB grows with time at the same logarithmic order as in the centralized counterpart where players act collectively as a single entity by exchanging observations and making decisions jointly. A general framework of constructing fair and order-optimal decentralized policies is established based on a Time Division Fair Sharing (TDFS) of the M best arms. A lower bound on the system regret growth rate is established for a general class of decentralized polices, to which all TDFS policies belong. We further develop several fair and order-optimal decentralized polices within the TDFS framework and study their performance in different applications including cognitive radio networks, multi-channel communications in unknown fading environment, target collecting in multi-agent systems, and web search and advertising.},

This article studies the couplings or interactions between the optimal design of a sensor system and quality management in a manufacturing system, which can improve cost-effectiveness and production yield by considering sensor cost, process change detection speed, and fault diagnosis accuracy. Based on an established definition of sensor allocation in a Bayesian network, an algorithm named ``Best Allocation Subsets by Intelligent Search'' (BASIS) is developed in this article to obtain the optimal sensor allocation design at minimum cost under different specified Average Run Length (ARL) requirements. Unlike previous approaches reported in the literature, the BASIS algorithm is developed based on investigating a multivariate T 2 control chart when only partial observations are available. After implementing the derived optimal sensor solution, a diagnosis ranking method is proposed to find the root cause variables by ranking all of the identified potential faults. Two case studies are conducted on a hot forming process and a cap alignment process to illustrate and evaluate the developed methods.},

Although a fully deployed sensor network will minimize information loss, the associated sensing cost can be overwhelming. Many efforts have been made to investigate the optimal sensor allocation strategy for different process control applications; however, most of them assume that the sensor layout is fixed once sensors are deployed in the system. This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptively reallocate sensor resources based on online observations, which can enhance both monitoring and diagnosis capabilities. The proposed adaptive sensor allocation strategy addresses two fundamental issues: when to reallocate sensors and how to update sensor layout. A max-min criterion is developed to manage sensor reallocation and process change detection in an integrated manner. To investigate the adaptive strategy, a Bayesian Network (BN) model is assumed available to represent the causal relationships among a set of variables. Case studies are performed on a hot forming process and a cap alignment process to illustrate the procedure and evaluate the performance of the proposed method under different fault scenarios.},

The algorithm has a Bayesian spirit in the sense that it selects arms based on posterior samples of reward probabilities of each arm. By forging a connection between combinatorial binary bandits and spike-and-slab variable selection, we propose a stochastic optimization approach to subset selection called Thompson variable selection (TVS). TVS is a framework for interpretable machine learning which does not rely on the underlying model to be linear. TVS brings together Bayesian reinforcement and machine learning in order to extend the reach of Bayesian subset selection to nonparametric models and large datasets with very many predictors and/or very many observations. Depending on the choice of a reward, TVS can be deployed in offline as well as online setups with streaming data batches. Tailoring multiplay bandits to variable selection, we provide regret bounds without necessarily assuming that the arm mean rewards be unrelated. We show a very strong empirical performance on both simulated and real data. Unlike deterministic optimization methods for spike-and-slab variable selection, the stochastic nature makes TVS less prone to local convergence and thereby more robust.},

We propose a simple test statistic based on lasso fitted values, called the covariance test statistic, and show that when the true model is linear, this statistic has an \$\textbackslash operatorname\{Exp\}(1)\$ asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis (the null being that all truly active variables are contained in the current lasso model). Our proof of this result for the special case of the first predictor to enter the model (i.e., testing for a single significant predictor variable against the global null) requires only weak assumptions on the predictor matrix \$X\$. On the other hand, our proof for a general step in the lasso path places further technical assumptions on \$X\$ and the generative model, but still allows for the important high-dimensional case \$p{$>$}n\$, and does not necessarily require that the current lasso model achieves perfect recovery of the truly active variables. Of course, for testing the significance of an additional variable between two nested linear models, one typically uses the chi-squared test, comparing the drop in residual sum of squares (RSS) to a \$\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\_\{1\}\$ distribution. But when this additional variable is not fixed, and has been chosen adaptively or greedily, this test is no longer appropriate: adaptivity makes the drop in RSS stochastically much larger than \$\textbackslash chi\^\{2\}\_\{1\}\$ under the null hypothesis. Our analysis explicitly accounts for adaptivity, as it must, since the lasso builds an adaptive sequence of linear models as the tuning parameter \$\textbackslash lambda\$ decreases. In this analysis, shrinkage plays a key role: though additional variables are chosen adaptively, the coefficients of lasso active variables are shrunken due to the \$\textbackslash ell\_\{1\}\$ penalty. Therefore, the test statistic (which is based on lasso fitted values) is in a sense balanced by these two opposing properties\textemdash adaptivity and shrinkage\textemdash and its null distribution is tractable and asymptotically \$\textbackslash operatorname\{Exp\}(1)\$.},

It is concerned with maximising the total rewards for a gambler by sequentially pulling an arm from a multi-armed slot machine where each arm is associated with a reward distribution. In static MABs, the reward distributions do not change over time, while in dynamic MABs, each arm's reward distribution can change, and the optimal arm can switch over time. Motivated by many real applications where rewards are binary, we focus on dynamic Bernoulli bandits. Standard methods like {$<$}inline-formula{$><$}tex-math id="M1"{$>\backslash$}begin\{document\}\$ \textbackslash epsilon \$\textbackslash end\{document\}{$<$}/tex-math{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$}-Greedy and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), which rely on the sample mean estimator, often fail to track changes in the underlying reward for dynamic problems.

This volume describes practical methods for ERP research along with the underlying theoretical rationale. It offers researchers and students an essential guide to designing, conducting, and analyzing ERP experiments. This second edition has been completely updated, with additional material, new chapters, and more accessible explanations. Freely available supplementary material, including several online-only chapters, offer expanded or advanced treatment of selected topics.The first half of the book presents essential background information, describing the origins of ERPs, the nature of ERP components, and the design of ERP experiments. The second half of the book offers a detailed treatment of the main steps involved in conducting ERP experiments, covering such topics as recording the EEG, filtering the EEG and ERP waveforms, and quantifying amplitudes and latencies. Throughout, the emphasis is on rigorous experimental design and relatively simple analyses. New material in the second edition includes entire chapters devoted to components, artifacts, measuring amplitudes and latencies, and statistical analysis; updated coverage of recording technologies; concrete examples of experimental design; and many more figures. Online chapters cover such topics as overlap, localization, writing and reviewing ERP papers, and setting up and running an ERP lab.},

  abstract = {The management and analysis of big data has been identified as one of the most important emerging needs in recent years. This is because of the sheer volume and increasing complexity of data being created or collected. Current clustering algorithms can not handle big data, and therefore, scalable solutions are necessary. Since fuzzy clustering algorithms have shown to outperform hard clustering approaches in terms of accuracy, this paper investigates the parallelization and scalability of a common and effective fuzzy clustering algorithm named fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm. The algorithm is parallelized using the MapReduce paradigm outlining how the Map and Reduce primitives are implemented. A validity analysis is conducted in order to show that the implementation works correctly achieving competitive purity results compared to state-of-the art clustering algorithms. Furthermore, a scalability analysis is conducted to demonstrate the performance of the parallel FCM implementation with increasing number of computing nodes used.},

The paper presents a general framework for online updating variable selection and parameter estimation in generalized linear models with streaming datasets.

The online updating coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to solve the online updating optimization problem. Moreover, a tuning parameter selection is suggested in an online updating way. The selection and estimation consistencies, and the oracle property are established, theoretically.

The multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) is ideal for monitoring the mean vector, and the multivariate exponentially weighted moving covariance matrix (MEWMC) detects changes in the covariance matrix. Both charts were established under the assumption that the parameters are known a priori. This is seldom the case, and Phase I data sets are commonly used to estimate the chart's in-control parameter values. Plugging in parameter estimates, however, fundamentally changes the run-length distribution from those assumed in the known-parameter theory and diminishes chart performance, even for large calibration samples. Self-starting methods, which correctly studentize the incoming stream of process readings, provide exact control right from start up. We extend the existing multivariate self-starting methodology to a combination chart for both the mean vector and the covariance matrix. This approach is shown to have good performance.},

  abstract = {Multivariate control charts are essential tools in multivariate statistical process control. In real applications, when a multivariate process shifts, it occurs in either location or scale. Several methods have been proposed recently to monitor the covariance matrix. Most of these methods deal with a full rank covariance matrix, i.e., in a situation where the number of rational subgroups is larger than the number of variables. When the number of features is nearly as large as, or larger than, the number of observations, existing Shewhart-type charts do not provide a satisfactory solution because the estimated covariance matrix is singular. A new Shewhart-type chart for monitoring changes in the covariance matrix of a multivariate process when the number of observations available is less than the number of variables is proposed. This chart can be used to monitor the covariance matrix with only one observation. The new control chart is based on using the graphical LASSO estimator of the covariance matrix instead of the traditional sample covariance matrix. The LASSO estimator is used here because of desirable properties such as being non-singular and positive definite even when the number of observations is less than the number of variables. The performance of this new chart is compared to that of several Shewhart control charts for monitoring the covariance matrix.},

Implementation of Gibbs sampling in more general MDP models is an open and important problem because most applications call for the use of nonconjugate base measures. In this article we propose a conceptual framework for computational strategies. This framework provides a perspective on current methods, facilitates comparisons between them, and leads to several new methods that expand the scope of MDP models to nonconjugate situations. We discuss one in detail. The basic strategy is based on expanding the parameter vector, and is applicable for MDP models with arbitrary base measure and likelihood. Strategies are also presented for the important class of normal-normal MDP models and for problems with fixed or few hyperparameters. The proposed algorithms are easily implemented and illustrated with an application.},

Machine learning has focused on the usefulness of probability models for prediction in social systems, but is only now coming to grips with the ways in which these models are wrong---and the consequences of those shortcomings. This paper attempts a comprehensive, structured overview of the specific conceptual, procedural, and statistical limitations of models in machine learning when applied to society. Machine learning modelers themselves can use the described hierarchy to identify possible failure points and think through how to address them, and consumers of machine learning models can know what to question when confronted with the decision about if, where, and how to apply machine learning. The limitations go from commitments inherent in quantification itself, through to showing how unmodeled dependencies can lead to cross-validation being overly optimistic as a way of assessing model performance.},

  abstract = {Entity resolution (ER; also known as record linkage or de-duplication) is the process of merging noisy databases, often in the absence of unique identifiers. A major advancement in ER methodology has been the application of Bayesian generative models, which provide a natural framework for inferring latent entities with rigorous quantification of uncertainty. Despite these advantages, existing models are severely limited in practice, as standard inference algorithms scale quadratically in the number of records. While scaling can be managed by fitting the model on separate blocks of the data, such a na\"ive approach may induce significant error in the posterior. In this article, we propose a principled model for scalable Bayesian ER, called ``distributed Bayesian linkage'' or d-blink, which jointly performs blocking and ER without compromising posterior correctness. Our approach relies on several key ideas, including: (i) an auxiliary variable representation that induces a partition of the entities and records into blocks; (ii) a method for constructing well-balanced blocks based on k-d trees; (iii) a distributed partially collapsed Gibbs sampler with improved mixing; and (iv) fast algorithms for performing Gibbs updates. Empirical studies on six datasets\textemdash including a case study on the 2010 Decennial Census\textemdash demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Focusing on standard statistical models and backed up by discussed real datasets available from the book website, it provides an operational methodology for conducting Bayesian inference, rather than focusing on its theoretical justifications. Special attention is paid to the derivation of prior distributions in each case and specific reference solutions are given for each of the models. Similarly, computational details are worked out to lead the reader towards an effective programming of the methods given in the book. While R programs are provided on the book website and R hints are given in the computational sections of the book, The Bayesian Core requires no knowledge of the R language and it can be read and used with any other programming language. The Bayesian Core can be used as a textbook at both undergraduate and graduate levels, as exemplified by courses given at Universit\'e Paris Dauphine (France), University of Canterbury (New Zealand), and University of British Columbia (Canada). It serves as a unique textbook for a service course for scientists aiming at analyzing data the Bayesian way as well as an introductory course on Bayesian statistics. The prerequisites for the book are a basic knowledge of probability theory and of statistics. Methodological and data-based exercises are included within the main text and students are expected to solve them as they read the book. Those exercises can obviously serve as assignments, as was done in the above courses. Datasets, R codes and course slides all are available on the book website.

  abstract = {The ergodic properties of SDEs, and various time discretizations for SDEs, are studied. The ergodicity of SDEs is established by using techniques from the theory of Markov chains on general state spaces, such as that expounded by Meyn\textendash Tweedie. Application of these Markov chain results leads to straightforward proofs of geometric ergodicity for a variety of SDEs, including problems with degenerate noise and for problems with locally Lipschitz vector fields. Applications where this theory can be usefully applied include damped-driven Hamiltonian problems (the Langevin equation), the Lorenz equation with degenerate noise and gradient systems. The same Markov chain theory is then used to study time-discrete approximations of these SDEs. The two primary ingredients for ergodicity are a minorization condition and a Lyapunov condition. It is shown that the minorization condition is robust under approximation. For globally Lipschitz vector fields this is also true of the Lyapunov condition. However in the locally Lipschitz case the Lyapunov condition fails for explicit methods such as Euler\textendash Maruyama; for pathwise approximations it is, in general, only inherited by specially constructed implicit discretizations. Examples of such discretization based on backward Euler methods are given, and approximation of the Langevin equation studied in some detail.},

We address the exploration-exploitation dilemma in a general setting encompassing both standard and contextualised bandit problems. The contextual bandit problem has recently resurfaced in attempts to maximise click-through rates in web based applications, a task with significant commercial interest. In this article we consider an approach of Thompson (1933) which makes use of samples from the posterior distributions for the instantaneous value of each action. We extend the approach by introducing a new algorithm, Optimistic Bayesian Sampling (OBS), in which the probability of playing an action increases with the uncertainty in the estimate of the action value. This results in better directed exploratory behaviour. We prove that, under unrestrictive assumptions, both approaches result in optimal behaviour with respect to the average reward criterion of Yang and Zhu (2002). We implement OBS and measure its performance in simulated Bernoulli bandit and linear regression domains, and also when tested with the task of personalised news article recommendation on a Yahoo! Front Page Today Module data set. We find that OBS performs competitively when compared to recently proposed benchmark algorithms and outperforms Thompson's method throughout.},

  abstract = {With its 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, the Trump administration expanded the scope of US nuclear deterrence, re-emphasizing the importance of non-strategic nuclear weapons, perceptively lowering the threshold for nuclear use and casting doubt on the future of arms control. The authors argue that these changes are consistent with the administration's wider `peace through strength' approach that draws on traditional Republican thinking on security policy. While designed to demonstrate credibility and resolve to both allies and adversaries, however, this assertive approach to security policy and specifically nuclear policy as a necessary precursor to renewed engagement in strategic negotiations may have unintended consequences. This article focuses on European reactions to the strategy and argues that the Trump administration's nuclear posture challenges common European understandings in three principal areas. First, changes to US declaratory policy contest European assumptions on the role of nuclear weapons in defending NATO. Second, US modernization plans and their implications for intra-alliance relations risk accentuating controversial debates about the US commitment to Europe. Third, the apparent US rejection of arms control widens the scope for discord with European leaders. If European leaders assert a clear and credible alternative vision advocating nuclear restraint, risk reduction and arms control they could rebuild trust and confidence between the United States, NATO and Russia, demonstrating real strength and ultimately leading to more genuine opportunities for peace and sustainable European security.},

They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.},

The spread of liberal democracy around the globe\textemdash essential for building that order\textemdash faced strong resistance because of nationalism, which emphasizes self-determination. Some targeted states also resisted U.S. efforts to promote liberal democracy for security-related reasons. Additionally, problems arose because a liberal order calls for states to delegate substantial decisionmaking authority to international institutions and to allow refugees and immigrants to move easily across borders. Modern nation-states privilege sovereignty and national identity, however, which guarantees trouble when institutions become powerful and borders porous. Furthermore, the hyperglobalization that is integral to the liberal order creates economic problems among the lower and middle classes within the liberal democracies, fueling a backlash against that order. Finally, the liberal order accelerated China's rise, which helped transform the system from unipolar to multipolar. A liberal international order is possible only in unipolarity. The new multipolar world will feature three realist orders: a thin international order that facilitates cooperation, and two bounded orders\textemdash one dominated by China, the other by the United States\textemdash poised for waging security competition between them.},

The Hesitant Hand examines how subsequent economic thinkers have challenged or reaffirmed Smith's doctrine, some contending that society needs government to intervene on its behalf when the marketplace falters, others arguing that government interference ultimately benefits neither the market nor society. Steven Medema explores what has been perhaps the central controversy in modern economics from Smith to today. He traces the theory of market failure from the 1840s through the 1950s and subsequent attacks on this view by the Chicago and Virginia schools. Medema follows the debate from John Stuart Mill through the Cambridge welfare tradition of Henry Sidgwick, Alfred Marshall, and A. C. Pigou, and looks at Ronald Coase's challenge to the Cambridge approach and the rise of critiques affirming Smith's doctrine anew. He shows how, following the marginal revolution, neoclassical economists, like the preclassical theorists before Smith, believed government can mitigate the adverse consequences of self-interested behavior, yet how the backlash against this view, led by the Chicago and Virginia schools, demonstrated that self-interest can also impact government, leaving society with a choice among imperfect alternatives. The Hesitant Hand demonstrates how government's economic role continues to be bound up in questions about the effects of self-interest on the greater good.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods operate in regimes that defy the traditional statistical mindset. The neural network architectures often contain more parameters than training samples, and are so rich that they can interpolate the observed labels, even if the latter are replaced by pure noise. Despite their huge complexity, the same architectures achieve small generalization error on real data.  This phenomenon has been rationalized in terms of a so-called `double descent' curve. As the model complexity increases, the generalization error follows the usual U-shaped curve at the beginning, first decreasing and then peaking around the interpolation threshold (when the model achieves vanishing training error). However, it descends again as model complexity exceeds this threshold. The global minimum of the generalization error is found in this overparametrized regime, often when the number of parameters is much larger than the number of samples. Far from being a peculiar property of deep neural networks, elements of this behavior have been demonstrated in much simpler settings, including linear regression with random covariates.  In this paper we consider the problem of learning an unknown function over the \$d\$-dimensional sphere \$\textbackslash mathbb S\^\{d-1\}\$, from \$n\$ i.i.d. samples \$(\textbackslash boldsymbol x\_i, y\_i) \textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb S\^\{d-1\} \textbackslash times \textbackslash mathbb R\$, \$i \textbackslash le n\$. We perform ridge regression on \$N\$ random features of the form \$\textbackslash sigma(\textbackslash boldsymbol w\_a\^\{\textbackslash mathsf T\}\textbackslash boldsymbol x)\$, \$a \textbackslash le N\$. This can be equivalently described as a two-layers neural network with random first-layer weights. We compute the precise asymptotics of the generalization error, in the limit \$N, n, d \textbackslash to \textbackslash infty\$ with \$N/d\$ and \$n/d\$ fixed. This provides the first analytically tractable model that captures all the features of the double descent phenomenon without assuming ad hoc misspecification structures.},

We show that neighborhood selection with the Lasso is a computationally attractive alternative to standard covariance selection for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Neighborhood selection estimates the conditional independence restrictions separately for each node in the graph and is hence equivalent to variable selection for Gaussian linear models. We show that the proposed neighborhood selection scheme is consistent for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Consistency hinges on the choice of the penalty parameter. The oracle value for optimal prediction does not lead to a consistent neighborhood estimate. Controlling instead the probability of falsely joining some distinct connectivity components of the graph, consistent estimation for sparse graphs is achieved (with exponential rates), even when the number of variables grows as the number of observations raised to an arbitrary power.},

However, there exist many real situations where one of the two responses (usually the most interesting for the analysis) is rare. It has been largely reported that this class imbalance heavily compromises the process of learning, because the model tends to focus on the prevalent class and to ignore the rare events. However, not only the estimation of the classification model is affected by a skewed distribution of the classes, but also the evaluation of its accuracy is jeopardized, because the scarcity of data leads to poor estimates of the model's accuracy. In this work, the effects of class imbalance on model training and model assessing are discussed. Moreover, a unified and systematic framework for dealing with the problem of imbalanced classification is proposed, based on a smoothed bootstrap re-sampling technique. The proposed technique is founded on a sound theoretical basis and an extensive empirical study shows that it outperforms the main other remedies to face imbalanced learning problems.},

This decomposition provides multiple insights: (I) Probabilistic sampling ensures high data quality by controlling {$\rho$}R,X{$\rho$}R,X\textbackslash rho\_\{\{R,X\}\} at the level of N-1/2N-1/2N\^\{-1/2\}; (II) When we lose this control, the impact of NNN is no longer canceled by {$\rho$}R,X{$\rho$}R,X\textbackslash rho\_\{\{R,X\}\}, leading to a Law of Large Populations (LLP), that is, our estimation error, relative to the benchmarking rate 1/n-{$\surd$}1/n1/\textbackslash sqrt\{n\}, increases with N--{$\surd$}N\textbackslash sqrt\{N\}; and (III) the ``bigness'' of such Big Data (for population inferences) should be measured by the relative size f=n/Nf=n/Nf=n/N, not the absolute size nnn; (IV) When combining data sources for population inferences, those relatively tiny but higher quality ones should be given far more weights than suggested by their sizes. Estimates obtained from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of the 2016 US presidential election suggest a {$\rho$}R,X{$\approx-$}0.005{$\rho$}R,X{$\approx-$}0.005\textbackslash rho\_\{\{R,X\}\}\textbackslash approx-0.005 for self-reporting to vote for Donald Trump. Because of LLP, this seemingly minuscule data defect correlation implies that the simple sample proportion of the self-reported voting preference for Trump from 1\%1\%1\textbackslash\% of the US eligible voters, that is, n{$\approx$}2,300,000n{$\approx$}2,300,000n\textbackslash approx2\textbackslash mbox\{,\}300\textbackslash mbox\{,\}000, has the same mean squared error as the corresponding sample proportion from a genuine simple random sample of size n{$\approx$}400n{$\approx$}400n\textbackslash approx400, a 99.98\%99.98\%99.98\textbackslash\% reduction of sample size (and hence our confidence). The CCES data demonstrate LLP vividly: on average, the larger the state's voter populations, the further away the actual Trump vote shares from the usual 95\%95\%95\textbackslash\% confidence intervals based on the sample proportions. This should remind us that, without taking data quality into account, population inferences with Big Data are subject to a Big Data Paradox: the more the data, the surer we fool ourselves.},

The field of Bayesian statistics has exploded over the past thirty years and is now an established field of research in mathematical statistics and computer science, a key component of data science, and an underpinning methodology in many domains of science, business and social science. Moreover, while remaining naturally entwined, the three arms of Bayesian statistics, namely modelling, computation and inference, have grown into independent research fields. While the research arms of Bayesian statistics continue to grow in many directions, they are harnessed when attention turns to solving substantive applied problems. Each such problem set has its own challenges and hence draws from the suite of research a bespoke solution.The book will be useful for both theoretical and applied statisticians, as well as practitioners, to inspect these solutions in the context of the problems, in order to draw further understanding, awareness and inspiration.},

When working with large-scale network data, the interconnected entities often have additional descriptive information. This additional metadata may provide insight that can be exploited for detection of anomalous events. In this paper, we use a generalized linear model for random attributed graphs to model connection probabilities using vertex metadata. For a class of such models, we show that an approximation to the exact model yields an exploitable structure in the edge probabilities, allowing for efficient scaling of a spectral framework for anomaly detection through analysis of graph residuals, and a fast and simple procedure for estimating the model parameters. In simulation, we demonstrate that taking into account both attributes and dynamics in this analysis has a much more significant impact on the detection of an emerging anomaly than accounting for either dynamics or attributes alone. We also present an analysis of a large, dynamic citation graph, demonstrating that taking additional document metadata into account emphasizes parts of the graph that would not be considered significant otherwise.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with the selection of subsets of predictor variables in a linear regression model for the prediction of a dependent variable. It is based on a Bayesian approach, intended to be as objective as possible. A probability distribution is first assigned to the dependent variable through the specification of a family of prior distributions for the unknown parameters in the regression model. The method is not fully Bayesian, however, because the ultimate choice of prior distribution from this family is affected by the data. It is assumed that the predictors represent distinct observables; the corresponding regression coefficients are assigned independent prior distributions. For each regression coefficient subject to deletion from the model, the prior distribution is a mixture of a point mass at 0 and a diffuse uniform distribution elsewhere, that is, a ``spike and slab'' distribution. The random error component is assigned a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation {$\sigma$}, where ln({$\sigma$}) has a locally uniform noninformative prior distribution. The appropriate posterior probabilities are derived for each submodel. If the regression coefficients have identical priors, the posterior distribution depends only on the data and the parameter {$\gamma$}, which is the height of the spike divided by the height of the slab for the common prior distribution. This parameter is not assigned a probability distribution; instead, it is considered a parameter that indexes the members of a class of Bayesian methods. Graphical methods are proposed as informal guides for choosing {$\gamma$}, assessing the complexity of the response function and the strength of the individual predictor variables, and assessing the degree of uncertainty about the best submodel. The following plots against {$\gamma$} are suggested: (a) posterior probability that a particular regression coefficient is 0; (b) posterior expected number of terms in the model; (c) posterior entropy of the submodel distribution; (d) posterior predictive error; and (e) posterior probability of goodness of fit. Plots (d) and (e) are suggested as ways to choose y. The predictive error is determined using a Bayesian cross-validation approach that generates a predictive density for each observation, given all of the data except that observation, that is, a type of ``leave one out'' approach. The goodness-of-fit measure is the sum of the posterior probabilities of all submodels that pass a standard F test for goodness of fit relative to the full model, at a specified level of significance. The dependence of the results on the scaling of the variables is discussed, and some ways to choose the scaling constants are suggested. Examples based on a large data set arising from an energy-conservation study are given to demonstrate the application of the methods.},

The accompanying software can be run by remote Internet users. The supporting web-sites include software for Java, C++, and other lan\- guages. A theoretical setting is described in which one can discuss a Bayesian adaptive choice of heuristics for discrete and global optimization prob\- lems. The techniques are evaluated in the spirit of the average rather than the worst case analysis. In this context, "heuristics" are understood to be an expert opinion defining how to solve a family of problems of dis\- crete or global optimization. The term "Bayesian Heuristic Approach" means that one defines a set of heuristics and fixes some prior distribu\- tion on the results obtained. By applying BHA one is looking for the heuristic that reduces the average deviation from the global optimum. The theoretical discussions serve as an introduction to examples that are the main part of the book. All the examples are interconnected. Dif\- ferent examples illustrate different points of the general subject. How\- ever, one can consider each example separately, too.},

Engineering process control (EPC) is usually applied to processes in which successive observations are related over time, and where the mean drifts dynamically. Thus, EPC seeks to minimize variability by transferring it from the output variable to a related process input (controllable) variable, while SPC seeks to reduce variability by detecting and eliminating assignable causes of variation. This paper shows through simulation that when using EPC it is always better to have an SPC system in place that monitors and acts properly on the root cause of the assignable change.},

In these applications, one of the most desired properties from such linear mappings is clustering, which means the locality between objects in the multidimensional space being preserved in the linear space. It is widely believed that the Hilbert space-filling curve achieves the best clustering (Abel and Mark, 1990; Jagadish, 1990). We analyze the clustering property of the Hilbert space-filling curve by deriving closed-form formulas for the number of clusters in a given query region of an arbitrary shape (e.g., polygons and polyhedra). Both the asymptotic solution for the general case and the exact solution for a special case generalize previous work. They agree with the empirical results that the number of clusters depends on the hypersurface area of the query region and not on its hypervolume. We also show that the Hilbert curve achieves better clustering than the z curve. From a practical point of view, the formulas given provide a simple measure that can be used to predict the required disk access behaviors and, hence, the total access time.},

  abstract = {Adapted from the acceptance sampling field, the double sampling monitoring schemes implement a two-stage strategy to decide whether the process being monitored is in-control or out-of-control. That is, a master sample is split into two separate subgroup samples, with the first subgroup sample used in the first stage and, depending on which type of double sampling method is used, either only the second or the combined first and second, subgroup sample(s) are used in the second stage. This strategy has been proven to effectively decrease the sampling effort and, at the same time, to decrease the time to detect potential out-of-control situations. For these reasons, it has received some attention in the statistical process monitoring (SPM) literature and, in this review paper, all 92 existing publications on the basic double sampling monitoring schemes and other different schemes that are integrated with the basic double sampling schemes are reviewed. The double sampling schemes are categorized and summarized so that any research gaps in the SPM literature can easily be identified. Finally, concluding remarks and some directions for future research ideas are given.},

  abstract = {Monitoring multivariate and high-dimensional data streams is often an essential requirement for quality management in manufacturing and service sectors in the Industry 4.0 era. Identifying a suitable distribution for a multivariate data set, especially when the number of variables is much larger than the sample size, is often challenging. Consequently, in a high-dimensional set-up, that is, when the number of variables under investigation exceeds sample size, parametric methods are generally not reliable in practice. There are various nonparametric schemes based on data depth for multivariate process monitoring, which are applicable only when the sample size is reasonably larger than the number of variables in the process but not in a high-dimensional set-up. We discuss that most of these charts are not robust when the true process parameters are unknown. There are, however, some nonparametric schemes for a high-dimensional process, when true process parameters are known. Nevertheless, when process parameters are unknown, a highly robust nonparametric scheme for monitoring high-dimensional processes is not yet available. In this paper, we propose some Shewhart-type nonparametric monitoring schemes based on specific distance metrics for surveillance of multivariate as well as high-dimensional processes. Our proposed charts are easy to implement, interpret and also advantageous in simultaneous monitoring of multiple aspects. We discuss the design and implementation issues in details. We carry out a performance study using Monte Carlo simulations and illustrate the proposed methods using a dataset related to industrial production.},

Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach.The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package\textemdash PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)\textemdash that is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level undergraduates with an introductory-level college math background and beginning graduate students.},

  abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can ample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

A statistical process monitoring (SPM) method based on multivariate statistics and system theory is introduced to monitor the variability of such processes. The statistical model that describes the in-control variability is based on a canonical-variate (CV) state-space model that is an equivalent representation of a vector autoregressive moving-average time-series model. The CV state variables obtained from the state-space model are linear combinations of the past process measurements that explain the variability of the future measurements the most. Because of this distinctive feature, the CV state variables are regarded as the principal dynamic directions A T2 statistic based on the CV state variables is used for developing an SPM procedure. Simple examples based on simulated data and an experimental application based on a high-temperature short-time milk pasteurization process illustrate advantages of the proposed SPM method.},

The importance of this paper, containing a new polynomial-time algorithm for linear op\- timization problems, was not only in its complexity bound. At that time, the most surprising feature of this algorithm was that the theoretical pre\- diction of its high efficiency was supported by excellent computational results. This unusual fact dramatically changed the style and direc\- tions of the research in nonlinear optimization. Thereafter it became more and more common that the new methods were provided with a complexity analysis, which was considered a better justification of their efficiency than computational experiments. In a new rapidly develop\- ing field, which got the name "polynomial-time interior-point methods", such a justification was obligatory. Afteralmost fifteen years of intensive research, the main results of this development started to appear in monographs [12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19]. Approximately at that time the author was asked to prepare a new course on nonlinear optimization for graduate students. The idea was to create a course which would reflect the new developments in the field. Actually, this was a major challenge. At the time only the theory of interior-point methods for linear optimization was polished enough to be explained to students. The general theory of self-concordant functions had appeared in print only once in the form of research monograph [12].},

Methods based on fully parametric mixture models are available, but lack of fit in some examples indicates that more flexible models may be beneficial. Existing, more flexible, mixture models work at the level of one-dimensional gene-specific summary statistics, and so when there are relatively few measurements per gene these methods may not provide sensitive detectors of differential expression. We propose a hierarchical mixture model to provide methodology that is both sensitive in detecting differential expression and sufficiently flexible to account for the complex variability of normalized microarray data. EM-based algorithms are used to fit both parametric and semiparametric versions of the model. We restrict attention to the two-sample comparison problem; an experiment involving Affymetrix microarrays and yeast translation provides the motivating case study. Gene-specific posterior probabilities of differential expression form the basis of statistical inference; they define short gene lists and false discovery rates. Compared to several competing methodologies, the proposed methodology exhibits good operating characteristics in a simulation study, on the analysis of spike-in data, and in a cross-validation calculation.},

In this paper, we proposed a new AEWMA control chart for monitoring the process mean in Bayesian theory under different loss functions (LFs). We used informative (conjugate prior) under two different LFs: (1) squared error loss function and (2) linex loss function for posterior and posterior predictive distributions. We used the average run length and standard deviation of run length to measure the performance of the AEWMA control chart in the Bayesian theory. A comparative study is conducted for comparing the proposed AEWMA control chart in Bayesian theory with the existing Bayesian EWMA control chart. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the proposed AEWMA control chart. For the implementation purposes, we presented a real-data example.},

We used the time between events data which follow the Exponential distribution and proposed the Bayesian EWMA control charts for Exponential distribution and transformed Exponential distributions into Inverse Rayleigh and Weibull distributions. In order to develop the control charts, we used a uniform prior under five different symmetric and asymmetric loss functions (LFs), namely, squared error loss function (SELF), precautionary loss function (PLF), general entropy loss function (GELF), entropy loss function (ELF), and weighted balance loss function (WBLF). The average run length (ARL) and the standard deviation of run length (SDRL) are used to check the performance of the proposed Bayesian EWMA control charts for Exponential and transformed Exponential distributions. An extensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate the proposed Bayesian EWMA control chart for nonnormal distributions. It is observed from the results that the proposed control chart with the Weibull distribution produces the best results among the considered distributions under different LFs. A real data example is presented for implementation purposes.},

The resulting identifiability problems are solved by restricting inference to the posterior distributions of invariant functions of the parameters and the vertex class membership. In addition, models are considered where class labels are identified by prior distributions for the class membership of some of the vertices.

The analysis of data based on multivariate spatial signs and ranks proceeds very much as does a traditional multivariate analysis relying on the assumption of multivariate normality; the regular L2 norm is just replaced by different L1 norms, observation vectors are replaced by spatial signs and ranks, and so on. A unified methodology starting with the simple one-sample multivariate location problem and proceeding to the general multivariate multiple linear regression case is presented. Companion estimates and tests for scatter matrices are considered as well. The R package MNM is available for computation of the procedures. This monograph provides an up-to-date overview of the theory of multivariate nonparametric methods based on spatial signs and ranks. The classical book by Puri and Sen (1971) uses marginal signs and ranks and different type of L1 norm.

  abstract = {Empirically analyzing empirical evidence One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONReproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. RATIONALEThere is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTSWe conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (Mr = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (Mr = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P {$<$} .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47\% of original effect sizes were in the 95\% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39\% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68\% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSIONNo single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here.Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that ``we already know this'' belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/349/6251/aac4716/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Original study effect size versus replication effect size (correlation coefficients).Diagonal line represents replication effect size equal to original effect size.

Finally, basic results of higher-order asymptotics are introduced (index notation, asymptotic expansions for statistics and distributions, and major applications to likelihood inference).The emphasis is more on general concepts and methods than on regularity conditions. Many examples are given for specific statistical models. Each chapter is supplemented with problems and bibliographic notes.

Most approaches assume exchangeability, leading to simple representations in terms of Exchangeable Partition Probability Functions (EPPF). Gibbs-type priors encompass a broad class of such cases, including Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes. Even though there have been some proposals to relax the exchangeability assumption, allowing covariate-dependence and partial exchangeability, limited consideration has been given on how to include concrete prior knowledge on the partition. For example, we are motivated by an epidemiological application, in which we wish to cluster birth defects into groups and we have prior knowledge of an initial clustering provided by experts. As a general approach for including such prior knowledge, we propose a Centered Partition (CP) process that modifies the EPPF to favor partitions close to an initial one. Some properties of the CP prior are described, a general algorithm for posterior computation is developed, and we illustrate the methodology through simulation examples and an application to the motivating epidemiology study of birth defects.},

However, in many real-world applications, this assumption may not hold. For example, we sometimes have a classification task in one domain of interest, but we only have sufficient training data in another domain of interest, where the latter data may be in a different feature space or follow a different data distribution. In such cases, knowledge transfer, if done successfully, would greatly improve the performance of learning by avoiding much expensive data-labeling efforts. In recent years, transfer learning has emerged as a new learning framework to address this problem. This survey focuses on categorizing and reviewing the current progress on transfer learning for classification, regression, and clustering problems. In this survey, we discuss the relationship between transfer learning and other related machine learning techniques such as domain adaptation, multitask learning and sample selection bias, as well as covariate shift. We also explore some potential future issues in transfer learning research.},

Roughly speaking, they measure the minimal effort required to reconfigure the probability mass of one distribution in order to recover the other distribution. They are ubiquitous in mathematics, with a long history that has seen them catalyse core developments in analysis, optimization, and probability. Beyond their intrinsic mathematical richness, they possess attractive features that make them a versatile tool for the statistician: they can be used to derive weak convergence and convergence of moments, and can be easily bounded; they are well-adapted to quantify a natural notion of perturbation of a probability distribution; and they seamlessly incorporate the geometry of the domain of the distributions in question, thus being useful for contrasting complex objects. Consequently, they frequently appear in the development of statistical theory and inferential methodology, and have recently become an object of inference in themselves. In this review, we provide a snapshot of the main concepts involved in Wasserstein distances and optimal transportation, and a succinct overview of some of their many statistical aspects.},

Gibbs sampling from this posterior is possible using an expanded hierarchy with conjugate normal priors for the regression parameters and independent exponential priors on their variances. A connection with the inverse-Gaussian distribution provides tractable full conditional distributions. The Bayesian Lasso provides interval estimates (Bayesian credible intervals) that can guide variable selection. Moreover, the structure of the hierarchical model provides both Bayesian and likelihood methods for selecting the Lasso parameter. Slight modifications lead to Bayesian versions of other Lasso-related estimation methods, including bridge regression and a robust variant.},

The liberal international order, set up after the Second World War and strengthened at the end of the Cold War, is going through a series of crises, propelled by deglobalization pressures, and the rise of illiberal and populist leaders, all challenging the three pillars of the liberal order: democracy, economic interdependence and international institutions. Two critical reasons for the decline of the liberal order are internal in terms of income distribution and institutional malaise. The article argues that the demise of the liberal order is not inevitable provided liberal states take remedial measures and adapt to the new environment as they did in 1919, 1930s, the second half of the 1940s, 1960s and 1991. Reformed globalization, or re-globalization is essential for facing the geopolitical challenges emanating from China and other illiberal states. The inability of other systems to offer both prosperity and freedom that the liberal order can provide is its main attractiveness. The connection between internal reforms in liberal states to address deepening inequalities and wealth distribution, a by-product of intensified globalization, and the prospects of liberal order's success is highlighted. The need for a refined welfare state taking into account the new realities to tackle the internal challenges is proposed.},

Although the analysis of profile data has been extensively studied in the SPC literature, the challenges associated with monitoring and diagnosis of multichannel (multiple) nonlinear profiles are yet to be addressed. Motivated by an application in multioperation forging processes, we propose a new modeling, monitoring, and diagnosis framework for phase-I analysis of multichannel profiles. The proposed framework is developed under the assumption that different profile channels have similar structure so that we can gain strength by borrowing information from all channels. The multidimensional functional principal component analysis is incorporated into change-point models to construct monitoring statistics. Simulation results show that the proposed approach has good performance in identifying change-points in various situations compared with some existing methods. The codes for implementing the proposed procedure are available in the supplementary material.},

Many existing methods require a time series of population and fishing pressure observations to estimate reference points to trigger decision rules. We demonstrate here the self-starting cumulative sum control chart (SS-CUSUM) where reference points are calibrated from indicator observations sequentially in real time as they are monitored. We used SS-CUSUM to monitor catch-based indicators from a simulated fishery where no previous scientific data are available. In the scenarios considered, the SS-CUSUM was successful in producing responses to fishing impacts with all indicators. A qualitative assessment on performance measures showed that the method worked best with indicators that represented the large fish component in landed catches (large fish indicators). Our study implies that neither a reference point nor a formal fish stock assessment is necessarily required to detect the impact of fishing on stock biomass. We discuss how SS-CUSUM could be incorporated into the assessment process for data poor fisheries.},

  abstract = {It is more than 20 years since Marysia Zalewski and feminist scholars posed `the man question' in International Relations, repositioning the gaze from female subjectivities to a problematization of the subjecthood of man. The field of masculinity studies has developed this initial question to a deep interrogation of the relationship between maleness and violence. Yet public and policy discourse often reduce the complexity of masculinities within extremism to issues of crisis and toxicity. Governments have prioritized the prevention of extremism, particularly violent Islamism, and in so doing have produced as `risk' particular racialized and marginalized men. This article asks, what are the effects of the toxic masculinity discourse in understanding the British radical right? It argues that current understandings of extremism neglect the central aim of Zalewski's `man' question to destabilize the field and deconstruct patriarchy. They instead position Islamophobia\textemdash which is institutionalized in state discourse\textemdash as the responsibility of particular `extreme' and `toxic' groups. In particular, the article outlines two ways in which `toxic masculinity' is an inadequate concept to describe activism in the anti-Islam(ist) movement the English Defence League (EDL). First, the term `toxic masculinity' occludes the continuities of EDL masculinities with wider patriarchal norms; second, it neglects the role of women as significant actors in the movement. Using an ethnographic and empathetic approach to this case-study, the article explores how Zalewski's theoretical position offers a route to analysis of the ways in which masculinities and patriarchy entwine in producing power and violence; and to a discussion of masculinities that need not equate manhood with threat.},

Abstract Technological advances led to increasingly larger industrial quality-related datasets calling for process monitoring methods able to handle them. In such context, the application of variable selection (VS) in quality control methods emerges as a promising research topic. This review aims at presenting the current state-of-the-art of the integration of VS in multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) methods. Proposals aligned with the objective were identified, classified according to VS approach, and briefly presented. Research on the topic has considerably increased in the past five years. Thirty methods were identified and categorized in 10 clusters, according to the objective of improvement in MSPC and the step of process monitoring they were aimed to improve. The majority of the propositions were either targeted at exclusively monitoring potential out-of-control variables or improving the monitoring of in-control variables. MSPC improvements were centered in principal component analysis (PCA) projection methods, while VS was mainly carried out using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method and genetic algorithms. Fault isolation was the most addressed step in process monitoring. We close the paper proposing five topics for future research, exploring the opportunities identified in the literature.},

There are, however, numerous contexts of considerable scientific interest in which the natural supports for the data under consideration are Riemannian manifolds like the unit circle, torus, sphere and their extensions. Typically, such data can be represented using one or more directions, and directional statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with their analysis. In this paper we provide a review of the many recent developments in the field since the publication of Mardia and Jupp (1999), still the most comprehensive text on directional statistics. Many of those developments have been stimulated by interesting applications in fields as diverse as astronomy, medicine, genetics, neurology, aeronautics, acoustics, image analysis, text mining, environmetrics, and machine learning. We begin by considering developments for the exploratory analysis of directional data before progressing to distributional models, general approaches to inference, hypothesis testing, regression, nonparametric curve estimation, methods for dimension reduction, classification and clustering, and the modelling of time series, spatial, and spatio-temporal data. We end with an overview of presently available software for analyzing directional data.},

  abstract = {Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words of the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these applications.},

The general conclusion of this study is that the weights can be used to test and protect against informative sampling designs and against misspecification of the model holding in the population. Six approaches for incorporating the weights in the inference process are considered. The first four approaches are intended to yield design consistent estimators for corresponding descriptive population quantities of the model parameters.

  abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

We argue that in many cases one can benefit from a decision theoretically justified two-stage approach: first, construct a possibly non-sparse model that predicts well, and then find a minimal subset of features that characterize the predictions. The model built in the first step is referred to as the \textbackslash emph\{reference model\} and the operation during the latter step as predictive \textbackslash emph\{projection\}. The key characteristic of this approach is that it finds an excellent tradeoff between sparsity and predictive accuracy, and the gain comes from utilizing all available information including prior and that coming from the left out features. We review several methods that follow this principle and provide novel methodological contributions. We present a new projection technique that unifies two existing techniques and is both accurate and fast to compute. We also propose a way of evaluating the feature selection process using fast leave-one-out cross-validation that allows for easy and intuitive model size selection. Furthermore, we prove a theorem that helps to understand the conditions under which the projective approach could be beneficial. The benefits are illustrated via several simulated and real world examples.},

The usual Poisson-Dirichlet distribution with a single parameter \$\textbackslash theta\$, introduced by Kingman, is \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(0, \textbackslash theta)\$. Known properties of \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(0, \textbackslash theta)\$, including the Markov chain description due to Vershik, Shmidt and Ignatov, are generalized to the two-parameter case. The size-biased random permutation of \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha, \textbackslash theta)\$ is a simple residual allocation model proposed by Engen in the context of species diversity, and rediscovered by Perman and the authors in the study of excursions of Brownian motion and Bessel processes. For \$0 {$<$} \textbackslash alpha {$<$} 1, \textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha, 0)\$ is the asymptotic distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a Markov chain away from a state whose recurrence time distribution is in the domain of attraction of a stable law of index \$\textbackslash alpha\$. Formulae in this case trace back to work of Darling, Lamperti and Wendel in the 1950s and 1960s. The distribution of ranked lengths of excursions of a one-dimensional Brownian motion is \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(1/2, 0)\$, and the corresponding distribution for a Brownian bredge is \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(1/2, 1/2)\$. The \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha, 0)\$ and \$\textbackslash mathsf\{PD\}(\textbackslash alpha, \textbackslash alpha)\$ distributions admit a similar interpretation in terms of the ranked lengths of excursions of a semistable Markov process whose zero set is the range of a stable subordinator of index \$\textbackslash alpha\$.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a resampling procedure called the stationary bootstrap as a means of calculating standard errors of estimators and constructing confidence regions for parameters based on weakly dependent stationary observations. Previously, a technique based on resampling blocks of consecutive observations was introduced to construct confidence intervals for a parameter of the m-dimensional joint distribution of m consecutive observations, where m is fixed. This procedure has been generalized by constructing a "blocks of blocks" resampling scheme that yields asymptotically valid procedures even for a multivariate parameter of the whole (i.e., infinite-dimensional) joint distribution of the stationary sequence of observations. These methods share the construction of resampling blocks of observations to form a pseudo-time series, so that the statistic of interest may be recalculated based on the resampled data set. But in the context of applying this method to stationary data, it is natural to require the resampled pseudo-time series to be stationary (conditional on the original data) as well. Although the aforementioned procedures lack this property, the stationary procedure developed here is indeed stationary and possesses other desirable properties. The stationary procedure is based on resampling blocks of random length, where the length of each block has a geometric distribution. In this article, fundamental consistency and weak convergence properties of the stationary resampling scheme are developed.},

Control charts are the tools quality practitioners use, and their monitoring performance is of major importance in practical applications. Since the values of the parameters used for the design of the charts' control limits are usually unknown in practice, the practitioners need to estimate them using an in-control retrospective sample. It has been shown that parameter estimation severely affects the control charts' properties. Many recent studies focused on investigating the impact of parameter estimates on the performance of control charts and on ways of diminishing this impact.

Careful prior and hyper-parameter specification are developed in light of performance and computational considerations, and key innovations address difficulties in exploring a joint posterior distribution over multiple subsets of high dimensional predictor inclusion vectors. The method offers state-of-the-art support and interaction recovery while improving dramatically over competitors in terms of prediction accuracy on a diverse set of simulated and real data.

  abstract = {A major tool for quality control and management, statistical process control (SPC) monitors sequential processes, such as production lines and Internet traffic, to ensure that they work stably and satisfactorily. Along with covering traditional methods, Introduction to Statistical Process Control describes many recent SPC methods that improve upon the more established techniques. The author\textemdash a leading researcher on SPC\textemdash shows how these methods can handle new applications.After exploring the role of SPC and other statistical methods in quality control and management, the book covers basic statistical concepts and methods useful in SPC. It then systematically describes traditional SPC charts, including the Shewhart, CUSUM, and EWMA charts, as well as recent control charts based on change-point detection and fundamental multivariate SPC charts under the normality assumption. The text also introduces novel univariate and multivariate control charts for cases when the normality assumption is invalid and discusses control charts for profile monitoring. All computations in the examples are solved using R, with R functions and datasets available for download on the author's website. Offering a systematic description of both traditional and newer SPC methods, this book is ideal as a primary textbook for a one-semester course in disciplines concerned with process quality control, such as statistics, industrial and systems engineering, and management sciences. It can also be used as a supplemental textbook for courses on quality improvement and system management. In addition, the book provides researchers with many useful, recent research results on SPC and gives quality control practitioners helpful guidelines on implementing up-to-date SPC techniques.},

They are used in more and more other applications, such as internet traffic monitoring, disease surveillance, and environmental protection. Traditional SPC charts designed for monitoring production lines in manufacturing industries are based on the assumptions that observed data are independent and identically distributed with a parametric in-control distribution. These assumptions, however, are rarely valid in practice. Therefore, recent SPC research focuses mainly on development of new control charts that are appropriate to use without these assumptions. In this article, we briefly introduce some recent studies on nonparametric SPC, control charts for monitoring dynamic processes, and spatio-temporal process monitoring. Control charts developed in these directions have found broad applications in practice.},

  abstract = {``Big data'' is a buzzword these days due to an enormous amount of data-rich applications in different industries and research projects. In practice, big data often take the form of data streams in the sense that new batches of data keep being collected over time. One fundamental research problem when analyzing big data in a given application is to monitor the underlying sequential process of the observed data to see whether it is longitudinally stable, or how its distribution changes over time. To monitor a sequential process, one major statistical tool is the statistical process control (SPC) charts, which have been developed and used mainly for monitoring production lines in the manufacturing industries during the past several decades. With many new and versatile SPC methods developed in the recent research, it is our belief that SPC can become a powerful tool for handling many big data applications that are beyond the production line monitoring. In this article, we introduce some recent SPC methods, and discuss their potential to solve some big data problems. Certain challenges in the interface between the current SPC research and some big data applications are also discussed.},

  abstract = {\textendash Statistical process control (SPC) charts are critically important for quality control and management in manufacturing industries, environmental monitoring, disease surveillance, and many other applications. Conventional SPC charts are designed for cases when process observations are independent at different observation times. In practice, however, serial data correlation almost always exists in sequential data. It has been well demonstrated in the literature that control charts designed for independent data are unstable for monitoring serially correlated data. Thus, it is important to develop control charts specifically for monitoring serially correlated data. To this end, there is some existing discussion in the SPC literature. Most existing methods are based on parametric time series modeling and residual monitoring, where the data are often assumed to be normally distributed. In applications, however, the assumed parametric time series model with a given order and the normality assumption are often invalid, resulting in unstable process monitoring. Although there is some nice discussion on robust design of such residual monitoring control charts, the suggested designs can only handle certain special cases well. In this article, we try to make another effort by proposing a novel control chart that makes use of the restarting mechanism of a CUSUM chart and the related spring length concept. Our proposed chart uses observations within the spring length of the current time point and ignores all history data that are beyond the spring length. It does not require any parametric time series model and/or a parametric process distribution. It only requires the assumption that process observation at a given time point is associated with nearby observations and independent of observations that are far away in observation times, which should be reasonable for many applications. Numerical studies show that it performs well in different cases.},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods have been widely used in different applications, including process control and monitoring. For handling statistical process control (SPC) problems, conventional supervised machine learning methods (e.g., artificial neural networks and support vector machines) would have some difficulties. For instance, a training dataset containing both in-control and out-of-control (OC) process observations is required by a supervised machine learning method, but it is rarely available in SPC applications. Furthermore, many machine learning methods work like black boxes. It is often difficult to interpret their learning mechanisms and the resulting decision rules in the context of an application. In the SPC literature, there have been some existing discussions on how to handle the lack of OC observations in the training data, using the one-class classification, artificial contrast, real-time contrast, and some other novel ideas. However, these approaches have their own limitations to handle SPC problems. In this article, we extend the self-starting process monitoring idea that has been employed widely in modern SPC research to a general learning framework for monitoring processes with serially correlated data. Under the new framework, process characteristics to learn are well specified in advance, and process learning is sequential in the sense that the learned process characteristics keep being updated during process monitoring. The learned process characteristics are then incorporated into a control chart for detecting process distributional shift based on all available data by the current observation time. Numerical studies show that process monitoring based on the new learning framework is more reliable and effective than some representative existing machine learning SPC approaches.},

  abstract = {Spatial boundary analysis has attained considerable attention in several disciplines including engineering, shape analysis, spatial statistics, and computer science. The inferential question of interest is often to identify rapid surface change of an unobserved latent process. Curvilinear wombling and crisp wombling (or fuzzy) are two major approaches that have emerged in Bayesian spatial statistics literature. These methods are limited to a single spatial scale even though data with multiple spatial scales are often accessible. Thus, we propose a multiscale representation of the directional derivative Karhunen\textendash Lo\'eve expansion to perform directionally based boundary detection. Taking a multiscale spatial perspective allows us, for the first time, to consider the concept of curvilinear boundary fallacy (CBF) error, which is a boundary detection analog to the ecological fallacy that is often studied in spatial change of support literature. Furthermore, we propose a directionally based multiscale curvilinear boundary error criterion to quantify CBF. We refer to this metric as the criterion for boundary aggregation error (BAGE), and use it to perform boundary detection. Several theoretical results are derived to motivate BAGE. In particular, we show that no BAGE exists when the directional derivatives of eigenfunctions of a KL expansion are constant across spatial scales. We illustrate the use of our model through a simulated example and an analysis of Mediterranean wind measurements data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

It is desirable to begin charting at or very near the beginning of the run in these cases. We present here the needed formulas so that charts for both the process mean and variance can be maintained from the start of production, whether or not prior information for estimating the parameters is available. These Q charts are all plotted in a standardized normal scale, and therefore permit the plotting of different statistics on the same chart. This will sometimes permit savings in the chart management program.},

Data arising in real applications are used throughout for both motivation and illustration, showing how functional approaches allow us to see new things, especially by exploiting the smoothness of the processes generating the data. The data sets exemplify the wide scope of functional data analysis; they are drawn from growth analysis, meteorology, biomechanics, equine science, economics, and medicine. The book presents novel statistical technology, much of it based on the authors' own research work, while keeping the mathematical level widely accessible. It is designed to appeal to students, to applied data analysts, and to experienced researchers; it will have value both within statistics and across a broad spectrum of other fields. This second edition is aimed at a wider range of readers, and especially those who would like to apply these techniques to their research problems. It complements the authors' other recent volume Applied Functional Data Analysis: Methods and Case Studies. In particular, there is an extended coverage of data smoothing and other matters arising in the preliminaries to a functional data analysis. The chapters on the functional linear model and modeling of the dynamics of systems through the use of differential equations and principal differential analysis have been completely rewritten and extended to include new developments. Other chapters have been revised substantially, often to give more weight to examples and practical considerations.

However, deriving a variational inference algorithm generally requires significant model-specific analysis, and these efforts can hinder and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem at hand. In this paper, we present a "black box" variational inference algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation. Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution. We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations. We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of longitudinal healthcare data.},

Subsequent research in statistics and the courses taught in the universities are mostly based on the guidelines set by these pioneers. Statistics is used in some form or other in all areas of human endeavor from scientific research to optimum use of resources for social welfare, prediction and decision-making. However, there are controversies in statistics, especially in the choice of a model for data, use of prior probabilities and subject-matter judgments by experts. The same data analyzed by different consulting statisticians may lead to different conclusions. What is the future of statistics in the present millennium dominated by information technology encompassing the whole of communications, interaction with intelligent systems, massive data bases, and complex information processing networks? The current statistical methodology based on simple probabilistic models developed for the analysis of small data sets appears to be inadequate to meet the needs of customers for quick on line processing of data and making the information available for practical use. Some methods are being put forward in the name of data mining for such purposes. A broad review of the current state of the art in statistics, its merits and demerits, and possible future developments is presented.},

GPs have received increased attention in the machine-learning community over the past decade, and this book provides a long-needed systematic and unified treatment of theoretical and practical aspects of GPs in machine learning. The treatment is comprehensive and self-contained, targeted at researchers and students in machine learning and applied statistics. The book deals with the supervised-learning problem for both regression and classification, and includes detailed algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel) functions are presented and their properties discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many connections to other well-known techniques from machine learning and statistics are discussed, including support-vector machines, neural networks, splines, regularization networks, relevance vector machines and others. Theoretical issues including learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are treated, and several approximation methods for learning with large datasets are discussed. The book contains illustrative examples and exercises, and code and datasets are available on the Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},

In fact, self-starting charts are useful in monitoring a process quickly, without having to collect a sizable Phase I sample for estimating the in-control process parameters. In this paper, a new self-starting control charting procedure is proposed in which first an effective initial sample is chosen from the perspective of Six Sigma quality, then the successive sample means are either pooled or not pooled (sometimes pooling procedure) for computing next Q-statistics depending upon its signal. It is observed that the sample statistics obtained so from this in-control Phase I situation can serve as more efficient estimators of unknown parameters for Phase II monitoring. An example is considered to illustrate the construction of the proposed chart and to compare its performance with the existing ones.},

A classification method first processes a training set of objects with given classes (labels), with the goal of afterward assigning new objects to one of these classes. When running the resulting prediction method on the training data or on test data, it can happen that an object is predicted to lie in a class that differs from its given label. This is sometimes called label bias, and raises the question whether the object was mislabeled. The proposed class map reflects the probability that an object belongs to an alternative class, how far it is from the other objects in its given class, and whether some objects lie far from all classes. The goal is to visualize aspects of the classification results to obtain insight in the data. The display is constructed for discriminant analysis, the k-nearest neighbor classifier, support vector machines, logistic regression, and coupling pairwise classifications. It is illustrated on several benchmark datasets, including some about images and texts.},

We achieve this dual purpose by extending the classic notion of prior sample size, M, in three directions: (I) estimating M beyond conjugate families; (II) formulating M as a relative notion that is as a function of the likelihood sample size k, M(k), which also leads naturally to a graphical diagnosis; and (III) permitting negative M, as a measure of prior-likelihood conflict, that is, harmful discordance. Our asymptotic regime permits the prior sample size to grow with the likelihood data size, hence making asymptotic arguments meaningful for investigating the impact of the prior relative to that of likelihood. It leads to a simple asymptotic formula for quantifying the impact of a proper prior that only involves computing a centrality and a spread measure of the prior and the posterior. We use simulated and real data to illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, including quantifying how weak is a `weakly informative' prior adopted in a study of lupus nephritis. Whereas we take a pragmatic perspective in assessing the impact of a prior on a given inference problem under a specific evaluative metric, we also touch upon conceptual and theoretical issues such as using improper priors and permitting priors with asymptotically non-vanishing influence.},

As a result, Moscow's military assertiveness and return to geopolitical rivalries since 2014 came as a surprise to many in the West. The article argues that small wars were never the major focus of Russian military transformation and reforms. Tracing the country's experience of war and conflict regionally and internationally since the end of the Cold War, and the impact this had on Moscow's views on what kind of armed forces it required, the article shows that the Kremlin's military ambitions started to diverge dramatically from western expectations as early as the mid-1990s. Russia never really saw armed forces geared towards small and `new war'-type scenarios as sufficient for upholding its regional and international status ambitions. Moreover, the Kremlin's growing preoccupation with internal order and regime stability has increasingly reinforced the rhetoric of a hostile West, which is used to justify the increasing centralization of domestic politics. Russia's military revival has been long in the making and poses serious challenges to its neighbours and to the West.},

Variable sampling rate (VSR) control charts vary the sampling rate as a function of the data from the process, and can detect most process changes significantly faster than traditional FSR control charts. The main focus of this article is on a type of VSR control chart called a variable sampling interval (VSI) control chart, but another type of VSR control chart based on sequential sampling is also considered. We consider the problem of detecting sustained or transient shifts in the mean or variability of a process. We investigate Shewhart control charts and multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) control charts based on sample means and on the sum of the squared deviations from target. We show that the combination of the standard MEWMA chart and an MEWMA-type chart based on squared deviations from target gives excellent overall performance. When the VSI feature is used with this combination, the performance is dramatically better than the performance of the standard FSR multivariate control charts that have traditionally been used.},

We briefly discuss a truncated form of the algorithm which, in practice, should avoid the difficulties of the other forms.},

These topics are developed around a decreasing chain of classes of distributions Lm, m = 0,1,...,{$\infty$}, from the class L0 of selfdecomposable distributions to the class L{$\infty$} generated by stable distributions through convolution and convergence.The book is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 studies basic properties of Lm classes needed for the subsequent chapters. Chapter 2 introduces Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type processes generated by a L\'evy process through stochastic integrals based on L\'evy processes. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a generating L\'evy process so that the OU type process has a limit distribution of Lm class.Chapter 3 establishes the correspondence between selfsimilar additive processes and selfdecomposable distributions and makes a close inspection of the Lamperti transformation, which transforms selfsimilar additive processes and stationary type OU processes to each other. Chapter 4 studies multivariate subordination of a cone-parameter L\'evy process by a cone-valued L\'evy process. Finally, Chapter 5 studies strictly stable and Lm properties inherited by the subordinated process in multivariate subordination.In this revised edition, new material is included on advances in these topics. It is rewritten as self-contained as possible. Theorems, lemmas, propositions, examples and remarks were reorganized; some were deleted and others were newly added. The historical notes at the end of each chapter were enlarged.This book is addressed to graduate students and researchers in probability and mathematical statistics who are interested in learning more on L\'evy processes and infinitely divisible distributions.},

High-dimensional data are now routinely analyzed, typically with many more covariates than observations. To broaden the applicability of Bayesian variable selection for such high-dimensional linear regression contexts, we propose EMVS, a deterministic alternative to stochastic search based on an EM algorithm which exploits a conjugate mixture prior formulation to quickly find posterior modes. Combining a spike-and-slab regularization diagram for the discovery of active predictor sets with subsequent rigorous evaluation of posterior model probabilities, EMVS rapidly identifies promising sparse high posterior probability submodels. External structural information such as likely covariate groupings or network topologies is easily incorporated into the EMVS framework. Deterministic annealing variants are seen to improve the effectiveness of our algorithms by mitigating the posterior multimodality associated with variable selection priors. The usefulness of the EMVS approach is demonstrated on real high-dimensional data, where computational complexity renders stochastic search to be less practical.},

In this article, we bridge this gap by cross-fertilizing these two paradigms with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO procedure for variable selection and parameter estimation in linear regression. We introduce a new class of self-adaptive penalty functions that arise from a fully Bayes spike-and-slab formulation, ultimately moving beyond the separable penalty framework. A virtue of these nonseparable penalties is their ability to borrow strength across coordinates, adapt to ensemble sparsity information and exert multiplicity adjustment. The Spike-and-Slab LASSO procedure harvests efficient coordinate-wise implementations with a path-following scheme for dynamic posterior exploration. We show on simulated data that the fully Bayes penalty mimics oracle performance, providing a viable alternative to cross-validation. We develop theory for the separable and nonseparable variants of the penalty, showing rate-optimality of the global mode as well as optimal posterior concentration when p {$>$} n.

  abstract = {Since their inception in the 1980's, regression trees have been one of the more widely used non-parametric prediction methods. Tree-structured methods yield a histogram reconstruction of the regression surface, where the bins correspond to terminal nodes of recursive partitioning. Trees are powerful, yet susceptible to over-fitting. Strategies against overfitting have traditionally relied on pruning greedily grown trees. The Bayesian framework offers an alternative remedy against overfitting through priors. Roughly speaking, a good prior charges smaller trees where overfitting does not occur. While the consistency of random histograms, trees and their ensembles has been studied quite extensively, the theoretical understanding of the Bayesian counterparts has been missing. In this paper, we take a step towards understanding why/when do Bayesian trees and their ensembles not overfit. To address this question, we study the speed at which the posterior concentrates around the true smooth regression function. We propose a spike-and-tree variant of the popular Bayesian CART prior and establish new theoretical results showing that regression trees (and their ensembles) (a) are capable of recovering smooth regression surfaces, achieving optimal rates up to a log factor, (b) can adapt to the unknown level of smoothness and (c) can perform effective dimension reduction when p{$>$}n. These results provide a piece of missing theoretical evidence explaining why Bayesian trees (and additive variants thereof) have worked so well in practice.},

To capture time-varying variable selection uncertainty, we introduce new dynamic shrinkage priors for the time series of regression coefficients. These priors are characterized by two main ingredients: smooth parameter evolutions and intermittent zeroes for modeling predictive breaks. More formally, our proposed Dynamic Spike-and-Slab (DSS) priors are constructed as mixtures of two processes: a spike process for the irrelevant coefficients and a slab autoregressive process for the active coefficients. The mixing weights are themselves time-varying and depend on lagged values of the series. Our DSS priors are probabilistically coherent in the sense that their stationary distribution is fully known and characterized by spike-and-slab marginals. For posterior sampling over dynamic regression coefficients, model selection indicators as well as unknown dynamic residual variances, we propose a Dynamic SSVS algorithm based on forward-filtering and backward-sampling. To scale our method to large data sets, we develop a Dynamic EMVS algorithm for MAP smoothing. We demonstrate, through simulation and a topical macroeconomic dataset, that DSS priors are very effective at separating active and noisy coefficients. Our fast implementation significantly extends the reach of spike-and-slab methods to big time series data.},

  abstract = {Q charts provide means for statistical process control in low-volume processes and start-up phases of production. Concerns on their performance have led to research into different types of enhancements and much discussion on the appropriateness of these. Driven by the aim to implement control charts in the low-volume production of advanced wafer steppers, we investigate the performance of additional run rules and tightening control limits on the traditional Q chart compared with an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). Furthermore, we develop an alternative QR chart based on the mean moving range as estimator of the process standard deviation and consider the economics of low-volume processes by means of a specific cost model. The comparisons are based on the run length distributions after a permanent shift and trend, both with an onset early in the process. Real life examples are given for various important variables in wafer stepper production. It is concluded that the EWMA based on QR statistics provides the best performance throughout. Competing alternatives with almost equal performance are the EWMA of Q statistics and the combination of four tests of special causes (1-of-1, 2-of-3, 4-of-5 and 8-of-8) applied on either the Q or QR chart. Overall, the mean moving range performs better. Copyright \textcopyright{} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Social networks, representing people who communicate with each other, are one example. Communities or clusters of highly connected actors form an essential feature in the structure of several empirical networks. Spectral clustering is a popular and computationally feasible method to discover these communities. The stochastic blockmodel [Social Networks 5 (1983) 109\textendash 137] is a social network model with well-defined communities; each node is a member of one community. For a network generated from the Stochastic Blockmodel, we bound the number of nodes ``misclustered'' by spectral clustering. The asymptotic results in this paper are the first clustering results that allow the number of clusters in the model to grow with the number of nodes, hence the name high-dimensional. In order to study spectral clustering under the stochastic blockmodel, we first show that under the more general latent space model, the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian asymptotically converge to the eigenvectors of a ``population'' normalized graph Laplacian. Aside from the implication for spectral clustering, this provides insight into a graph visualization technique. Our method of studying the eigenvectors of random matrices is original.},

  abstract = {The most prevalent approach to activation localization in neuroimaging is to identify brain regions as contiguous supra-threshold clusters, check their significance using random field theory, and correct for the multiple clusters being tested. Besides recent criticism on the validity of the random field assumption, a spatial specificity paradox remains: the larger the detected cluster, the less we know about the location of activation within that cluster. This is because cluster inference implies ``there exists at least one voxel with an evoked response in the cluster'', and not that ``all the voxels in the cluster have an evoked response''. Inference on voxels within selected clusters is considered bad practice, due to the voxel-wise false positive rate inflation associated with this circular inference. Here, we propose a remedy to the spatial specificity paradox. By applying recent results from the multiple testing statistical literature, we are able to quantify the proportion of truly active voxels within selected clusters, an approach we call All-Resolutions Inference (ARI). If this proportion is high, the paradox vanishes. If it is low, we can further ``drill down'' from the cluster level to sub-regions, and even to individual voxels, in order to pinpoint the origin of the activation. In fact, ARI allows inference on the proportion of activation in all voxel sets, no matter how large or small, however these have been selected, all from the same data. We use two fMRI datasets to demonstrate the non-triviality of the spatial specificity paradox, and its resolution using ARI. We verify that the endless circularity permitted by ARI does not render its estimates overly conservative using both simulation, and a data split.},

We consider the general problem of detecting a change in the location and/or scale parameter of a stream of random variables, and adapt several nonparametric hypothesis tests to create a streaming change detection algorithm. This algorithm uses a test statistic with a null distribution independent of the data. This allows a desired rate of false alarms to be maintained for any stream even when its distribution is unknown.

Through an in-depth analysis of representations in the collective identities of six popular online anti-feminist communities based in India, Russia and the United States, I shed light on how anti-feminists discursively construct their anti-feminist `self' and the feminist `other' between narratives of localized resistance to change and backlash against the results of broader societal developments associated with globalization. The results expose a complex set of global\textendash local dynamics, which provide a nuanced understanding of the differences and commonalities of anti-feminist collective identity-building and mobilization processes across contexts. By explicitly focusing on the role of discursively produced locations for anti-feminist identity-building and providing new evidence on anti-feminist communities across three different continents, the article contributes to current discussions on transnational anti-feminist mobilizations in both social movement studies and feminist International Relations.},

The basic techniques and theorems of analysis are presented in such a way that the intimate connections between its various branches are strongly emphasized. The traditionally separate subjects of 'real analysis' and 'complex analysis' are thus united in one volume. Some of the basic ideas from functional analysis are also included. This is the only book to take this unique approach. The third edition includes a new chapter on differentiation. Proofs of theorems presented in the book are concise and complete and many challenging exercises appear at the end of each chapter. The book is arranged so that each chapter builds upon the other, giving students a gradual understanding of the subject.

An old approximate technique is the Laplace method or approximation, which dates back to Pierre-Simon Laplace (1774). This simple idea approximates the integrand with a second-order Taylor expansion around the mode and computes the integral analytically. By developing a nested version of this classical idea, combined with modern numerical techniques for sparse matrices, we obtain the approach of integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) to do approximate Bayesian inference for latent Gaussian models (LGMs). LGMs represent an important model abstraction for Bayesian inference and include a large proportion of the statistical models used today. In this review, we discuss the reasons for the success of the INLA approach, the R-INLA package, why it is so accurate, why the approximations are very quick to compute, and why LGMs make such a useful concept for Bayesian computing.},

The practical implementation of any scatterplot smoother is greatly enhanced by the availability of a reliable rule for automatic selection of the smoothing parameter. In this article we apply the ideas of plug-in bandwidth selection to develop strategies for choosing the smoothing parameter of local linear squares kernel estimators. Our results are applicable to odd-degree local polynomial fits and can be extended to other settings, such as derivative estimation and multiple nonparametric regression. An implementation in the important case of local linear fits with univariate predictors is shown to perform well in practice. A by-product of our work is the development of a class of nonparametric variance estimators, based on local least squares ideas, and plug-in rules for their implementation.}

  abstract = {A data-based local bandwidth selector is proposed for nonparametric regression by local fitting of polynomials. The estimator, called the empirical-bias bandwidth selector (EBBS), is rather simple and easily allows multivariate predictor variables and estimation of any order derivative of the regression function. EBBS minimizes an estimate of mean squared error consisting of a squared bias term plus a variance term. The variance term used is exact, not asymptotic, though it involves the conditional variance of the response given the predictors that must be estimated. The bias term is estimated empirically, not from an asymptotic expression. Thus EBBS is similar to the ``double smoothing'' approach of H\"ardle, Hall, and Marron and a local bandwidth selector of Schucany, but is developed here for a far wider class of estimation problems than what those authors considered. EBBS is tested on simulated data, and its performance seems quite satisfactory. Local polynomial smoothing of a histogram is a highly effective technique for density estimation, and several of the examples involve density estimation by EBBS applied to binned data.},

This tutorial covers the algorithm and its application, illustrating concepts through a range of examples, including Bernoulli bandit problems, shortest path problems, product recommendation, assortment, active learning with neural networks, and reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes. Most of these problems involve complex information structures, where information revealed by taking an action informs beliefs about other actions.

It argues that, as the fundamental unit of governance, zoning provides keen insight into the mechanics of maritime security. The article observes that Britain's Hovering Acts in the late eighteenth century represent the earliest example of modern zonation at sea and that they exhibit a shift from early modern territorial claims based on imperium and dominium. The article explores the way these hovering zones shaped the rationale underlying contemporary maritime security. It finds that maritime security has effectively relegated national security to a minor spatial belt of state power, while elevating non-traditional understandings of security to the level of global existential threat. The future of maritime security is under construction. Increasingly segmented by interconnecting, overlapping, multi-functional zones that seek to regulate all free movement and usage of the sea, security developments are reorganizing the maritime sphere. Nonetheless, the article argues, despite the novelty of this development, a historical military logic persists in new formations of security-oriented practices of maritime governance.},

Working in this area is like skating on the edge of reason. Unfortunately, no comprehensive treatment has ever been attempted other than the gallant effort by W. Sierpiriski in 1912. At that time, the subject was still in its infancy and the most interesting and perplexing results were still to come. Besides, Sierpiriski's paper was written in Polish and published in a journal that is not readily accessible (Sierpiriski [2]). Most of the early literature on the subject is in French, German, and Polish, providing an additional raison d'etre for a comprehensive treatment in English. While there was, understandably, some intensive research activity on this subject around the turn of the century, contributions have, nevertheless, continued up to the present and there is no end in sight, indicating that the subject is still very much alive. The recent interest in fractals has refocused interest on space\- filling curves, and the study of fractals has thrown some new light on this small but venerable part of mathematics. This monograph is neither a textbook nor an encyclopedic treatment of the subject nor a historical account, but it is a little of each. While it may lend structure to a seminar or pro-seminar, or be useful as a supplement in a course on topology or mathematical analysis, it is primarily intended for self-study by the aficionados of classical analysis.},

The crisis was a symptom of the three-fold failure to achieve the aspirations to create a `Europe whole and free' enunciated by the Charter of Paris in 1990, the drift in the European Union's behaviour from normative to geopolitical concerns, and the failure to institutionalize some form of pan-continental unity. The structural failure to create a framework for normative and geopolitical pluralism on the continent meant that Russia was excluded from the new European order. No mode of reconciliation was found between the Brussels-centred wider Europe and various ideas for greater European continental unification. Russia's relations with the EU became increasingly tense in the context of the Eastern Partnership and the Association Agreement with Ukraine. The EU and the Atlantic alliance moved towards a more hermetic and universal form of Atlanticism. Although there remain profound differences between the EU and its trans-Atlantic partner and tensions between member states, the new Atlanticism threatens to subvert the EU's own normative principles. At the same time, Russia moved from a relatively complaisant approach to Atlanticism towards a more critical neo-revisionism, although it does not challenge the legal or normative intellectual foundations of international order. This raises the question of whether we can speak of the `death of Europe' as a project intended to transcend the logic of conflict on the continent.},

To achieve good performance, several formats may need to be used in one program, requiring explicit selection and conversion between the formats. This can be both tedious and error-prone, especially for non-expert users. Motivated by this issue, we present a user-friendly sparse matrix class for the C++ language, with a high-level application programming interface deliberately similar to the widely used MATLAB language. The class internally uses two main approaches to achieve efficient execution: (i) a hybrid storage framework, which automatically and seamlessly switches between three underlying storage formats (compressed sparse column, coordinate list, Red-Black tree) depending on which format is best suited for specific operations, and (ii) template-based meta-programming to automatically detect and optimise execution of common expression patterns. To facilitate relatively quick conversion of research code into production environments, the class and its associated functions provide a suite of essential sparse linear algebra functionality (eg., arithmetic operations, submatrix manipulation) as well as high-level functions for sparse eigendecompositions and linear equation solvers. The latter are achieved by providing easy-to-use abstractions of the low-level ARPACK and SuperLU libraries.

  abstract = {Random vector functional-link (RVFL) networks are randomized multilayer perceptrons with a single hidden layer and a linear output layer, which can be trained by solving a linear modeling problem. In particular, they are generally trained using a closed-form solution of the (regularized) least-squares approach. This paper introduces several alternative strategies for performing full Bayesian inference (BI) of RVFL networks. Distinct from standard or classical approaches, our proposed Bayesian training algorithms allow to derive an entire probability distribution over the optimal output weights of the network, instead of a single pointwise estimate according to some given criterion (e.g., least-squares). This provides several known advantages, including the possibility of introducing additional prior knowledge in the training process, the availability of an uncertainty measure during the test phase, and the capability of automatically inferring hyper-parameters from given data. In this paper, two BI algorithms for regression are first proposed that, under some practical assumptions, can be implemented by a simple iterative process with closed-form computations. Simulation results show that one of the proposed algorithms, Bayesian RVFL, is able to outperform standard training algorithms for RVFL networks with a proper regularization factor selected carefully via a line search procedure. A general strategy based on variational inference is also presented, with an application to data modeling problems with noisy outputs or outliers. As we discuss in this paper, using recent advances in automatic differentiation this strategy can be applied to a wide range of additional situations in an immediate fashion.},

These algorithms are computationally efficient, minimally storage-intensive, and allow for possible rank deficiencies in the subset design matrices due to rare-event covariates. Within the linear model setting, the proposed online-updating framework leads to predictive residual tests that can be used to assess the goodness-of-fit of the hypothesized model. We also propose a new online-updating estimator under the estimating equation setting. Theoretical properties of the goodness-of-fit tests and proposed estimators are examined in detail. In simulation studies and real data applications, our estimator compares favorably with competing approaches under the estimating equation setting.},

It is shown that estimators based on sparsely connected deep neural networks with ReLU activation function and properly chosen network architecture achieve the minimax rates of convergence (up to log n-factors) under a general composition assumption on the regression function. The framework includes many well-studied structural constraints such as (generalized) additive models. While there is a lot of flexibility in the network architecture, the tuning parameter is the sparsity of the network. Specifically, we consider large networks with number of potential parameters being much bigger than the sample size. The analysis gives some insights why multilayer feedforward neural networks perform well in practice. Interestingly, the depth (number of layers) of the neural network architectures plays an important role and our theory suggests that scaling the network depth with the logarithm of the sample size is natural.},

Yet, despite some analyses of the importance of time at the political/grand strategic level (usually by scholars) and at the tactical level (usually by military professionals) there is surprisingly little discussion of the impact of time on the preparation and the conduct of warfare. This article introduces the concept of `wartime paradigm' as a heuristic device to understand the relationship between the perception of time and the conduct of warfare, and argues that after the Cold War, a specific `wartime paradigm' combining an optimization for speed and an understanding of war as risk management has guided western warfare, from force structure to the conduct of actual operations. It shows how the changing character of warfare directly challenges this wartime paradigm and why, if western forces want to prevail in future conflicts, the establishment of a new wartime paradigm guiding technological improvements and operational concepts is critical.},

The extended tapered block bootstrap has wider applicability than the tapered block bootstrap, while preserving the favorable bias and mean squared error properties of the tapered block bootstrap over the moving block bootstrap.

Traditional control charts, whose control limits are often determined before the control charts are activated, are constructed based on perfect knowledge of sample sizes. In practice, however, future sample sizes are often unknown. Making an inappropriate assumption of the distribution function could lead to unexpected performance of the control charts, for example, excessive false alarms in the early runs of the control charts, which would in turn hurt an operator's confidence in valid alarms. To overcome this problem, we propose the use of probability control limits, which are determined based on the realization of sample sizes online. The conditional probability that the charting statistic exceeds the control limit at present given that there has not been a single alarm before can be guaranteed to meet a specified false alarm rate. Simulation studies show that our proposed control chart is able to deliver satisfactory run length performance for any time-varying sample sizes. The idea presented in this article can be applied to any effective control charts such as the exponentially weighted moving average or cumulative sum chart. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Almost all previous control schemes for the detection of increases in the Poisson rate in Phase II are constructed based on assumed knowledge of the process parameters, for example, the expectation of the count of a rare event when the process of interest is in control. In practice, however, this parameter is usually unknown and not able to be estimated with a sufficiently large number of reference samples. A self-starting exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control scheme based on a parametric bootstrap method is proposed. The success of the proposed method lies in the use of probability control limits, which are determined based on the observations during rather than before monitoring. Simulation studies show that our proposed scheme has good in-control and out-of-control performance under various situations. In particular, our proposed scheme is useful in rare event studies during the start-up stage of a monitoring process. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

The nature of the Russian system has, to a great extent, been influenced by Yeltsin, who strengthened demands not for independent institutions but for a new and more powerful authoritarian leadership. Putin has consolidated the system, based on personalized power. But despite signs of economic growth and outward stability there is evidence that the Russian system is unsustainable in the long-term. The current system is based on a modification of the petro-economy that reproduces the merger between power and business with the rentier class. Thus far, however, the model has not been able to solve social conflicts or stop the degradation of `human capital'. Nor is it likely to do so in the future.},

In reality, however, it is often important to deal with situations where the mean of the monitoring sequence has a dynamic shift pattern, e.g., residuals from a time series. In these cases, the conventional control charts may perform poorly, as they do not consider the information due to what is known as ``forecast recovery'' contained in the patterned mean shift. This paper proposes a new weighted cumulative sum (WCUSUM) procedure for monitoring a sequence with a patterned mean shift. This method first estimates the dynamic mean of the sequence, then uses the estimates for weighting the incremental in the conventional CUSUM chart. Guidelines for designing the WCUSUM chart are proposed, and the performance is compared with that of the conventional CUSUM chart and other alternatives for detecting patterned mean shifts. It is found that the WCUSUM chart performs far superior to other charts for detecting small to moderate shifts when forecast recovery is present and performs competitively otherwise.},

These simple, but powerful statistical techniques, take Bayesian statistics beyond the need to specify overly simplified models, to the setting where the model is defined only as a process that generates data. This process can be arbitrarily complex, to the point where standard Bayesian techniques based on working with tractable likelihood functions would not be viable. ABC methods finesse the problem of model complexity within the Bayesian framework by exploiting modern computational power, thereby permitting approximate Bayesian analyses of models that would otherwise be impossible to implement. The Handbook of ABC provides illuminating insight into the world of Bayesian modelling for intractable models for both experts and newcomers alike. It is an essential reference book for anyone interested in learning about and implementing ABC techniques to analyse complex models in the modern world.},

Each chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a self-contained, teachable technical introduction and a brief review of the further developments; many of the chapters conclude with exercises. The book is structured as follows. The first four chapters are on IID rewards, from the basic model to impossibility results to Bayesian priors to Lipschitz rewards. The next three chapters cover adversarial rewards, from the full-feedback version to adversarial bandits to extensions with linear rewards and combinatorially structured actions. Chapter 8 is on contextual bandits, a middle ground between IID and adversarial bandits in which the change in reward distributions is completely explained by observable contexts. The last three chapters cover connections to economics, from learning in repeated games to bandits with supply/budget constraints to exploration in the presence of incentives. The appendix provides sufficient background on concentration and KL-divergence. The chapters on "bandits with similarity information", "bandits with knapsacks" and "bandits and agents" can also be consumed as standalone surveys on the respective topics.},

However, most existing monitoring schemes consider the individual stages of the healthcare process without considering both inter-stage and intra-stage links. The modeling of multistage healthcare processes based on the state-space model describes the cascade property of the risks and outcomes in subsequent stages. The present paper proposes a Bernoulli state-space model in which unmeasurable risks of processes are considered as a latent risk variable to give a realistic estimate of potential risks. In the proposed monitoring scheme for multistage medical processes, in addition to Parsonnet scores, the other categorical operational covariates are considered. Moreover, dynamic probability control limits are applied to remove the effect of patient risk distributions on in-control average run length performance. Simulation results reveal that the proposed risk-adjusted Bernoulli group exponentially weighted moving average chart for multistage healthcare processes performs satisfactorily under different shifts. Moreover, the proposed monitoring scheme helps to identify the out-of-control stage of the healthcare process to remove the corresponding assignable cause.},

  abstract = {Stochastic approximation (SA) has long been applied for problems of minimizing loss functions or root finding with noisy input information. As with all stochastic search algorithms, there are adjustable algorithm coefficients that must be specified, and that can have a profound effect on algorithm performance. It is known that choosing these coefficients according to an SA analog of the deterministic Newton-Raphson algorithm provides an optimal or near-optimal form of the algorithm. However, directly determining the required Hessian matrix (or Jacobian matrix for root finding) to achieve this algorithm form has often been difficult or impossible in practice. The paper presents a general adaptive SA algorithm that is based on a simple method for estimating the Hessian matrix, while concurrently estimating the primary parameters of interest. The approach applies in both the gradient-free optimization (Kiefer-Wolfowitz) and root-finding/stochastic gradient-based (Robbins-Monro) settings, and is based on the "simultaneous perturbation (SP)" idea introduced previously. The algorithm requires only a small number of loss function or gradient measurements per iteration-independent of the problem dimension-to adaptively estimate the Hessian and parameters of primary interest. Aside from introducing the adaptive SP approach, the paper presents practical implementation guidance, asymptotic theory, and a nontrivial numerical evaluation. Also included is a discussion and numerical analysis comparing the adaptive SP approach with the iterate-averaging approach to accelerated SA.},

The methods can also be used to test for a change in row probabilities of a contingency table, allowing for extramultinomial variation.

First, data are divided into smaller computationally tractable subsets. Second, posterior draws of parameters are obtained for every subset after modifying subset posteriors using stochastic approximation. Finally, the empirical measures of samples from each subset posterior are combined through their barycenter in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. Stochastic approximation ensures that posterior uncertainty quantification of the barycenter matches with that of the full data posterior distribution. The combining step can be conducted efficiently through a sparse linear program, which takes negligible time relative to sampling from subset posteriors, facilitating scaling to massive data. WASP is very general and allows application of existing sampling algorithms to massive data with minimal modifications. We provide theoretical conditions under which rate of convergence of WASP to the delta measure centered at the true parameter coincides with the optimal parametric rate up to a logarithmic factor. WASP is applied for scalable Bayesian computations in a nonparametric mixture model and a movie recommender database containing tens of millions of ratings.},

In this paper we focus on developing a novel family of multiscale stick-breaking mixture models that inherits some of the advantages of both single-scale nonparametric mixtures and P\'olya trees. Our proposal is based on a mixture specification exploiting an infinitely deep binary tree of random weights that grows according to a multiscale generalization of a large class of stick-breaking processes; this multiscale stick-breaking is paired with specific stochastic processes generating sequences of parameters that induce stochastically ordered kernel functions. Properties of this family of multiscale stick-breaking mixtures are described. Focusing on a Gaussian specification, a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior computation is introduced. The performance of the method is illustrated analyzing both synthetic and real datasets consistently showing competitive results both in scenarios favoring single-scale and multiscale methods. The results suggest that the method is well suited to estimate densities with varying degree of smoothness and local features.},

Our key innovation involves the representation of the pattern of links between records as a bipartite graph, in which records are directly linked to latent true individuals, and only indirectly linked to other records. This flexible representation of the linkage structure naturally allows us to estimate the attributes of the unique observable people in the population, calculate transitive linkage probabilities across records (and represent this visually), and propagate the uncertainty of record linkage into later analyses. Our method makes it particularly easy to integrate record linkage with post-processing procedures such as logistic regression, capture-recapture, etc. Our linkage structure lends itself to an efficient, linear-time, hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which overcomes many obstacles encountered by previously record linkage approaches, despite the high-dimensional parameter space. We illustrate our method using longitudinal data from the National Long Term Care Survey and with data from the Italian Survey on Household and Wealth, where we assess the accuracy of our method and show it to be better in terms of error rates and empirical scalability than other approaches in the literature.},

This paper introduces the Fuzzy C-means++ algorithm which, by utilizing the seeding mechanism of the K-means++ algorithm, improves the effectiveness and speed of Fuzzy C-means. By careful seeding that disperses the initial cluster centers through the data space, the resulting Fuzzy C-means++ approach samples starting cluster representatives during the initialization phase. The cluster representatives are well spread in the input space, resulting in both faster convergence times and higher quality solutions. Implementations in R of standard Fuzzy C-means and Fuzzy C-means++ are evaluated on various data sets. We investigate the cluster quality and iteration count as we vary the spreading factor on a series of synthetic data sets. We run the algorithm on real world data sets and to account for the non-determinism inherent in these algorithms we record multiple runs while choosing different k parameter values. The results show that the proposed method gives significant improvement in convergence times (the number of iterations) of up to 40 (2.1 on average) times the standard on synthetic datasets and, in general, an associated lower cost function value and Xie\textendash Beni value. A proof sketch of the logarithmically bounded expected cost function value is given.},

It can also be seen as an extension of RNNsearch to the case where multiple computational steps (hops) are performed per output symbol. The flexibility of the model allows us to apply it to tasks as diverse as (synthetic) question answering and to language modeling. For the former our approach is competitive with Memory Networks, but with less supervision. For the latter, on the Penn TreeBank and Text8 datasets our approach demonstrates comparable performance to RNNs and LSTMs. In both cases we show that the key concept of multiple computational hops yields improved results.},

In contrast, the self-starting chart begins controlling the process without the need for preliminary observations, an advantage when production is slow or when the cost of early out-of-control production is high. Furthermore, the use of estimated parameters substantially degrades the expected performance of conventional charts, a problem avoided by the proposed chart. The self-starting chart uses the deviation of each observation vector from the average of all previous observations. These deviations, or innovations, can be plotted on a T\textsuperscript{2} control chart or accumulated in a multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) chart. The run-length performance is evaluated for step shifts occurring at various points, and the MEWMA charts are shown to outperform T\textsuperscript{2} charts in rapidly detecting process changes.

This new edition of Wilson Sutherland's classic text introduces metric and topological spaces by describing some of that influence. The aim is to move gradually from familiar real analysis to abstract topological spaces, using metric spaces as a bridge between the two. The language of metric and topological spaces is established with continuity as the motivating concept. Several concepts are introduced, first in metric spaces and then repeated for topological spaces, to help convey familiarity. The discussion develops to cover connectedness, compactness and completeness, a trio widely used in the rest of mathematics. Topology also has a more geometric aspect which is familiar in popular expositions of the subject as `rubber-sheet geometry', with pictures of M\"obius bands, doughnuts, Klein bottles and the like; this geometric aspect is illustrated by describing some standard surfaces, and it is shown how all this fits into the same story as the more analytic developments. The book is primarily aimed at second- or third-year mathematics students. There are numerous exercises, many of the more challenging ones accompanied by hints, as well as a companion website, with further explanations and examples as well as material supplementary to that in the book.},

  abstract = {Detection of emerging topics are now receiving renewed interest motivated by the rapid growth of social networks. Conventional term-frequency-based approaches may not be appropriate in this context, because the information exchanged are not only texts but also images, URLs, and videos. We focus on the social aspects of theses networks. That is, the links between users that are generated dynamically intentionally or unintentionally through replies, mentions, and retweets. We propose a probability model of the mentioning behaviour of a social network user, and propose to detect the emergence of a new topic from the anomaly measured through the model. We combine the proposed mention anomaly score with a recently proposed change-point detection technique based on the Sequentially Discounting Normalized Maximum Likelihood (SDNML), or with Kleinberg's burst model. Aggregating anomaly scores from hundreds of users, we show that we can detect emerging topics only based on the reply/mention relationships in social network posts. We demonstrate our technique in a number of real data sets we gathered from Twitter. The experiments show that the proposed mention-anomaly-based approaches can detect new topics at least as early as the conventional term-frequency-based approach, and sometimes much earlier when the keyword is ill-defined.},

In Snijders and Nowicki (1997) and Nowicki and Snijders (2001), a Bayesian approach to blockmodels is presented, where the probability of a relation between two actors depends only on the classes to which the actors belong but is independent of the actors. When actors are a priori partitioned into subsets based on actor attributes such as race, sex and income, the model proposed by Nowicki and Snijders completely ignores this extra piece of information. In this paper, a blockmodel that is a simple extension of their model is proposed specifically for such data. The class affiliation probabilities are modeled conditional on the actor attributes via a multinomial probit model. Posterior distributions of the model parameters, and predictive posterior distributions of the class affiliation probabilities are computed by using a straightforward Gibbs sampling algorithm. Applications are illustrated with analysis on real and simulated data sets},

We show how this model can be profitably adopted both in record linkage problems and in capture\textendash recapture setups, where the size of a finite population is the real object of interest. There are at least two important differences between the proposed model-based approach and the current practice in record linkage. First, the statistical model is built up on the actually observed categorical variables and no reduction (to 0\textendash 1 comparisons) of the available information takes place. Second, the hierarchical structure of the model allows a two-way propagation of the uncertainty between the parameter estimation step and the matching procedure so that no plug-in estimates are used and the correct uncertainty is accounted for both in estimating the population size and in performing the record linkage. We illustrate and motivate our proposal through a real data example and simulations.},

  abstract = {The cumulative sum charting procedure is traditionally used in the manufacturing industry for monitoring the quality of products. Recently, it has been extended to monitoring surgical outcomes. Unlike a manufacturing process where the raw material is usually reasonably homogeneous, patients' risks of surgical failure are usually different. It has been proposed in the literature that the binary outcomes from a surgical procedure be adjusted using the preoperative risk based on a likelihood-ratio scoring method. Such a crude classification of surgical outcome is naive. It is unreasonable to regard a patient who has a full recovery, the same quality outcome as another patient who survived but remained bed-ridden for life. For a patient who survives an operation, there can be many different grades of recovery. Thus, it makes sense to consider a risk-adjusted cumulative sum charting procedure based on more than two outcomes to better monitor surgical performance. In this article, we develop such a chart and study its performance.},

We hypothesize that the local immune micro-environment of NSCLC is associated with patient outcomes and that these local immune features exhibit distinct radiologic characteristics discernible by quantitative imaging metrics. We assembled two cohorts of NSCLC patients treated with definitive surgical resection and extracted quantitative parameters from pretreatment CT imaging. The excised primary tumors were then quantified for percent tumor PDL1 expression and density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (via CD3 count) utilizing immunohistochemistry and automated cell counting. Associating these pretreatment radiomics parameters with tumor immune parameters, we developed an immune pathology-informed model (IPIM) that separated patients into 4 clusters (designated A-D) utilizing 4 radiomics features. The IPIM designation was significantly associated with overall survival in both training (5 year OS: 61\%, 41\%, 50\%, and 91\%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P\,=\,0.04) and validation (5 year OS: 55\%, 72\%, 75\%, and 86\%, for clusters A-D, respectively, P\,=\,0.002) cohorts and immune pathology (all P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Specifically, we identified a favorable outcome group characterized by low CT intensity and high heterogeneity that exhibited low PDL1 and high CD3 infiltration, suggestive of a favorable immune activated state. We have developed a NSCLC radiomics signature based on the immune micro-environment and patient outcomes. This manuscript demonstrates model creation and validation in independent cohorts.},

However, the analysis of the performance of this procedure in terms of the average detection delay and false alarm probability has been an open problem. In this paper, we develop a general asymptotic change-point detection theory that is not limited to a restrictive i.i.d. assumption. In particular, we investigate the performance of the Shiryaev procedure for general discrete-time stochastic models in the asymptotic setting, where the false alarm probability approaches zero. We show that the Shiryaev procedure is asymptotically optimal in the general non-i.i.d. case under mild conditions. We also show that the two popular non-Bayesian detection procedures, namely the Page and the Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak procedures, are generally not optimal (even asymptotically) under the Bayesian criterion. The results of this study are shown to be especially important in studying the asymptotics of decentralized change detection procedures.},

Detection of changes in a process can be done using control charts. One of these charts, the self-starting CUSUM chart, was created to detect small sustained changes and be implemented without a Phase I or a priori knowledge of the parameters of the process. To estimate the time of a detected change, a CUSUM-based change-point estimator can be used, but experiments show that the corresponding MLE has smaller bias and standard error. This paper proposes the sequential use of the self-starting CUSUM chart and the MLE of a change point in series of independent normal observations. Performance is studied with Monte Carlo simulations showing that the use of the MLE reduces the bias of the change-point estimation. It is also shown how extra observations after a change is detected can be used to improve estimation of the change-point time. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Statistical process control (SPC) has been extensively used in many different industries including automotive, electronics, and aerospace, among others. SPC tools such as control charts, process capability analysis, sampling inspection, etc., have definitive and powerful impact on quality control and improvement for mass production and similar production systems. In aerospace manufacturing, however, applications of SPC tools are more challenging, especially when these tools are implemented in processes producing products of large sizes with slower production rates. For instance, following a widely accepted rule-of-thumb, about 100 units of products are required in the first phase of implementing a Shewhart type control chart. Once established, it then can be used for process control in the second phase for actual production process monitoring and control. In many aerospace production processes, however, it requires that quality control measures be in place from the time that the first unit of product is produced. Certain types of control charts for self-starting (without the first phase) and for short production runs (as few as 3 units) have been developed by researchers and practitioners. They have been tested and used in places where traditional Shewhart control charts are difficult to apply. In this work, we used Monte-Carlo simulation to study the suitability of applying Q-chart, one of the available self-starting control charts, in comparison with I/MR-X chart for short production runs. The preliminary results suggest that a combination of Cusum Q-chart and Cusum I/MR-X chart be considered for better quality monitoring and control.}

Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

The fused lasso penalizes the L1-norm of both the coefficients and their successive differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients and also sparsity of their differences\textemdash i.e. local constancy of the coefficient profile. The fused lasso is especially useful when the number of features p is much greater than N, the sample size. The technique is also extended to the `hinge' loss function that underlies the support vector classifier. We illustrate the methods on examples from protein mass spectroscopy and gene expression data.},

Although the VB posterior is an approximation, it has been shown to produce good parameter estimates and predicted values when a rich classes of approximating distributions are considered. In this paper we propose Updating VB (UVB), a recursive algorithm used to update a sequence of VB posterior approximations in an online setting, with the computation of each posterior update requiring only the data observed since the previous update. An extension to the proposed algorithm, named UVB-IS, allows the user to trade accuracy for a substantial increase in computational speed through the use of importance sampling. The two methods and their properties are detailed in two separate simulation studies. Two empirical illustrations of the proposed UVB methods are provided, including one where a Dirichlet Process Mixture model with a novel posterior dependence structure is repeatedly updated in the context of predicting the future behaviour of vehicles on a stretch of the US Highway 101.},

Multi\textendash Armed Bandits (MABs) have been widely considered in the last decade to model settings in which an agent wants to learn the action providing the highest expected reward among a fixed set of available actions during the operational life of a system. Classical techniques provide solutions that minimize the regret due to learning in settings where selecting an arm has no cost. Though, in many real world applications the learner has to pay some cost for pulling each arm and the learning process is constrained by a fixed budgetB. This problem is addressed in the literature as the Budgeted MAB (BMAB). In this paper, for the first time, we study the problem of Budgeted Continuous\textendash Armed Bandit (BCAB), where the set of the possible actions consists in a continuous set (e.g., a range of prices) and the learner suffers from a random reward and cost at each round. We provide a novel algorithm, named B\textendash Zoom, which suffers a regret of \~O(B d+1 d+2 ), where d is the Zooming dimension of the problem. Finally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that, despite a lower average performance, the proposed approach is more robust to adverse settings as compared to existing algorithms designed for BMAB.},

Apart from savings on the resources consumed by the preliminary phase, the alternative approach described here is able to detect any analytic problems during the startup and provide a foundation for subsequent conventional assessment. A new dynamically updated predictive control chart (PCC) is used. Being Bayesian in concept, it utilizes available prior information. The manufacturer's prior quality control target value, the manufacturer's maximum acceptable interassay coefficient of variation value and the interassay standard deviation value defined during method validation in each laboratory, allow online IQC management. An Excel template, downloadable from journal website, allows easy implementation of this alternative approach in any laboratory. In the practical case of prothrombin percentage measurement, PCC gave no false alarms with respect to the 1ks rule (with same 5\% false-alarm probability on a single control sample) during an overlap phase between two IQC batches. Moreover, PCCs were as effective as the 1ks rule in detecting increases in both random and systematic error after the minimal preliminary phase required by medical biology guidelines. PCCs can improve efficiency in medical biology laboratories.},

These charts all assume that the in-control true mean is known, a common fiction that is addressed by gathering a large Phase I sample and using it to estimate the mean. ``Self-starting'' proposals that ameliorate the need for a large Phase I sample have also appeared. All these methods are frequentist, ie, they allow only retrospective inference during Phase I, and they have no coherent way to incorporate less-than-perfect prior information about the in-control mean. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian procedure that can incorporate prior information, allow online inference, and should be particularly attractive for short-run settings where large Phase I calibration exercises are impossible or unreasonable.},

Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem.  This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field. This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms. The book sharpens the reader's intuition on how to think about missing data, and provides all the tools needed to execute a well-grounded quantitative analysis in the presence of missing data.},

The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation.

Penalized regression overcomes this non-identifiability by augmentation of the loss function by a penalty (i.e. a function of regression coefficients). The ridge penalty is the sum of squared regression coefficients, giving rise to ridge regression. Here many aspect of ridge regression are reviewed e.g. moments, mean squared error, its equivalence to constrained estimation, and its relation to Bayesian regression. Finally, its behaviour and use are illustrated in simulation and on omics data. Subsequently, ridge regression is generalized to allow for a more general penalty. The ridge penalization framework is then translated to logistic regression and its properties are shown to carry over. To contrast ridge penalized estimation, the final chapter introduces its lasso counterpart.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

In this chapter, two formulations of the quickest change detection problem, Bayesian and minimax, are introduced, and optimal or asymptotically optimal solutions to these formulations are discussed. Then some generalizations and extensions of the quickest change detection problem are described. The chapter is concluded with a discussion of applications and open issues.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {A common divide-and-conquer approach for Bayesian computation with big data is to partition the data, perform local inference for each piece separately, and combine the results to obtain a global posterior approximation. While being conceptually and computationally appealing, this method involves the problematic need to also split the prior for the local inferences; these weakened priors may not provide enough regularization for each separate computation, thus eliminating one of the key advantages of Bayesian methods. To resolve this dilemma while still retaining the generalizability of the underlying local inference method, we apply the idea of expectation propagation (EP) as a framework for distributed Bayesian inference. The central idea is to iteratively update approximations to the local likelihoods given the state of the other approximations and the prior. The present paper has two roles: we review the steps that are needed to keep EP algorithms numerically stable, and we suggest a general approach, inspired by EP, for approaching data partitioning problems in a way that achieves the computational benefits of parallelism while allowing each local update to make use of relevant information from the other sites. In addition, we demonstrate how the method can be applied in a hierarchical context to make use of partitioning of both data and parameters. The paper describes a general algorithmic framework, rather than a specific algorithm, and presents an example implementation for it.},

Traditional \$\textbackslash widehat\{R\}\$ will fail to correctly diagnose convergence failures when the chain has a heavy tail or when the variance varies across the chains. In this paper we propose an alternative rank-based diagnostic that fixes these problems. We also introduce a collection of quantile-based local efficiency measures, along with a practical approach for computing Monte Carlo error estimates for quantiles.

Implementations of S are available commercially in S-PLUS(R) workstations and as the Open Source R for a wide range of computer systems. The aim of this book is to show how to use S as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book is intended for would-be users of S-PLUS or R and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state of the art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis, pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This fourth edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 6.0 or R 1.5.0 or later. A substantial change from the third edition is updating for the current versions of S-PLUS and adding coverage of R. The introductory material has been rewritten to emphasis the import, export and manipulation of data.

  abstract = {It is common practice to compare the fit of non-nested models using the Akaike (AIC) or Bayesian (BIC) information criteria. The basis of these criteria is the log-likelihood evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown parameters. For the general linear model (and the linear mixed model, which is a special case), estimation is usually carried out using residual or restricted maximum likelihood (REML). However, for models with different fixed effects, the residual likelihoods are not comparable and hence information criteria based on the residual likelihood cannot be used. For model selection, it is often suggested that the models are refitted using maximum likelihood to enable the criteria to be used. The first aim of this paper is to highlight that both the AIC and BIC can be used for the general linear model by using the full log-likelihood evaluated at the REML estimates. The second aim is to provide a derivation of the criteria under REML estimation. This aim is achieved by noting that the full likelihood can be decomposed into a marginal (residual) and conditional likelihood and this decomposition then incorporates aspects of both the fixed effects and variance parameters. Using this decomposition, the appropriate information criteria for model selection of models which differ in their fixed effects specification can be derived. An example is presented to illustrate the results and code is available for analyses using the ASReml-R package.},

  abstract = {A nonparametric control chart for variance is proposed. The chart is constructed following the change-point approach through the recursive use of the squared ranks test for variance. It is capable of detecting changes in the behaviour of individual observations with performance similar to a self-starting CUSUM chart for scale when normality is assumed, and a relatively better power when assessing nonnormal observations. A comparison is also made with two equivalent nonparametric charts based on Mood and Ansari-Bradley statistics. When dealing with symmetrical distributions, the proposed chart shows smaller (better) out-of-control average run length (ARL), and a competing performance otherwise. In addition, sensitivity to changes in mean and variance at the same time was tested. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation was used to measure performance, and a practical example is provided to illustrate how the proposed control chart can be implemented in practice.},

On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

We equip the space of vertex labellings with a prior on the number of classes and, conditionally, a prior on the labels. The number of classes may grow to infinity as a function of the number of vertices, depending on the sparsity of the graph. We derive non-asymptotic posterior contraction rates of the form \$P\_\{\textbackslash theta\_\{0,n\}\}\textbackslash Pi\_n(B\_n\textbackslash mid X\^n)\textbackslash le \textbackslash epsilon\_n\$, where \$X\^n\$ is the observed graph, generated according to \$P\_\{\textbackslash theta\_\{0,n\}\}\$, \$B\_n\$ is either \$\textbackslash\{\textbackslash theta\_\{0, n\}\textbackslash\}\$ or, in the very sparse case, a ball around \$\textbackslash theta\_\{0,n\}\$ of known extent, and \$\textbackslash epsilon\_n\$ is an explicit rate of convergence.  These results enable conversion of credible sets to confidence sets. In the sparse case, credible tests are shown to be confidence sets. In the very sparse case, credible sets are enlarged to form confidence sets. Confidence levels are explicit, for each \$n\$, as a function of the credible level and the rate of convergence.  Hypothesis testing between the number of classes is considered with the help of posterior odds, and is shown to be consistent. Explicit upper bounds on errors of the first and second type and an explicit lower bound on the power of the tests are given.},

As opposed to popular algorithms such as agglomerative hierarchical clustering or k-means which return a single clustering solution, Bayesian nonparametric models provide a posterior over the entire space of partitions, allowing one to assess statistical properties, such as uncertainty on the number of clusters. However, an important problem is how to summarize the posterior; the huge dimension of partition space and difficulties in visualizing it add to this problem. In a Bayesian analysis, the posterior of a real-valued parameter of interest is often summarized by reporting a point estimate such as the posterior mean along with 95\% credible intervals to characterize uncertainty. In this paper, we extend these ideas to develop appropriate point estimates and credible sets to summarize the posterior of the clustering structure based on decision and information theoretic techniques.},

Using this viewpoint, we show that the dropout regularizer is first-order equivalent to an L2 regularizer applied after scaling the features by an estimate of the inverse diagonal Fisher information matrix. We also establish a connection to AdaGrad, an online learning algorithm, and find that a close relative of AdaGrad operates by repeatedly solving linear dropout-regularized problems. By casting dropout as regularization, we develop a natural semi-supervised algorithm that uses unlabeled data to create a better adaptive regularizer. We apply this idea to document classification tasks, and show that it consistently boosts the performance of dropout training, improving on state-of-the-art results on the IMDB reviews dataset.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for BNN learning via closed-form Bayesian inference. For this purpose, the calculation of the predictive distribution of the output and the update of the weight distribution are treated as Bayesian filtering and smoothing problems, where the weights are modeled as Gaussian random variables. This allows closed-form expressions for training the network's parameters in a sequential/online fashion without gradient descent. We demonstrate our method on several UCI datasets and compare it to the state of the art.},

Results show that the Hotelling {$\chi$}2 chart and the MEWMA chart are only effective for a small range of shift sizes in the mean vector, while the GLR chart and some carefully designed multi-MEWMA combinations can give similarly better overall performance in detecting a wide range of shift magnitudes. Unlike most of these other options, the GLR chart does not require specification of tuning-parameter values by the user. The GLR chart also has the advantage in process diagnostics: at the time of a signal, estimates of change-point and out-of-control mean vector are immediately available to the user. All these advantages of the GLR chart make it a favorable option for practitioners. For the design of the GLR chart, a series of easy-to-use equations are provided to users for calculating the control limit to achieve a desired in-control performance.},

It is assumed that for each individual local data stream, either there are no local changes, or there is a "big" local change that is larger than a pre-specified lower bound. Two different kinds of scenarios are studied: one is the sparse post-change case when the unknown number of affected data streams is much smaller than the total number of data streams, and the other is when all local data streams are affected simultaneously although not necessarily identically. We propose a systematic approach to develop efficient global monitoring schemes for quickest change detection by combining hard thresholding with linear shrinkage estimators to estimating all post-change parameters simultaneously. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the shrinkage estimation can balance the tradeoff between the first-order and second-order terms of the asymptotic expression on the detection delays, and our numerical simulation studies illustrate the usefulness of shrinkage estimation and the challenge of Monte Carlo simulation of the average run length to false alarm in the context of online monitoring large-scale data streams.},

In this article we consider the problem of online monitoring a class of big data streams where each data stream is associated with a spatial location. Our goal is to quickly detect shifts occurring in such big data streams when only partial information can be observed at each time and the out-of-control variables are clustered in a small and unknown region. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel spatial-adaptive sampling and monitoring (SASAM) procedure that aims to leverage the spatial information of the data streams for quick change detection. Specifically, the proposed sampling strategy will adaptively and intelligently integrate two seemingly contradictory ideas: (1) random sampling that quickly searches for possible out-of-control variables; and (2) directional sampling that focuses on highly suspicious out-of-control variables that may cluster in a small region. Simulation and real case studies show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing sampling strategy without taking the spatial information of the data streams into consideration.},

We present a Dirichlet process Gaussian state machine (DPGSM) model to represent dynamic intermittency, which is one of the most ubiquitous real-world transient behaviors. The DPGSM model treats a signal as a random walk among a Dirichlet process mixture of Gaussian clusters. Hypothesis tests and a numerical scheme based on this nonparametric representation were developed to detect subtle changes in the transient (intermittent) dynamics. Experimental investigations suggest that the DPGSM approach can consistently detect incipient, critical changes in intermittent signals some 50\textendash 2000 ms (20\textendash 90\%) ahead of competing methods in benchmark test cases as well as a variety of real-world applications, such as in alternation patterns (e.g., ragas) in a music piece, and in the vibration signals capturing the initiation of product defects in an ultraprecision manufacturing process. A supplementary file to this article, available online, includes a Matlab implementation of the presented DPGSM.},

  abstract = {Monitoring multichannel profiles has important applications in manufacturing systems improvement, but it is nontrivial to develop efficient statistical methods because profiles are high-dimensional functional data with intrinsic inner- and interchannel correlations, and that the change might only affect a few unknown features of multichannel profiles. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel thresholded multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) method for multichannel profile monitoring. Our proposed method consists of two steps of dimension reduction: It first applies the functional PCA to extract a reasonably large number of features under the in-control state, and then uses the soft-thresholding techniques to further select significant features capturing profile information under the out-of-control state. The choice of tuning parameter for soft-thresholding is provided based on asymptotic analysis, and extensive numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed thresholded PCA methodology.},

In addition, by adding the variable sampling interval (VSI) feature to the proposed charts, the new VSI one-sided EWMA t charts are shown to detect different shift sizes in the process more efficient than the chart without VSI feature.

Most existing methods to solve that problem are based on either a sequence of hypothesis tests or model selection, by introducing some extra tuning parameters that may not be easy to determine in practice. This article aims to develop a data-driven new methodology for determining the number of jumps, using an order-preserved sample-splitting strategy together with a cross-validation-based criterion. Statistical consistency of the determined number of jumps by our proposed method is established. More interestingly, the proposed method allows us to move beyond just point estimation, and it can quantify uncertainty of the proposed estimate. The key idea behind our method is the construction of a series of statistics with marginal symmetry property and this property can be used for choosing a data-driven threshold to control the false discovery rate of our method. The proposed method is computationally efficient. Numerical experiments indicate that it has a reliable performance in finite-sample cases. An R package jra is developed to implement the proposed method.},

  abstract = {We derive run-length distributions of the special-cause control chart proposed by Alwan and Roberts for correlated observations, given that the assignable cause to be detected is a shift in the process mean. Both recursive and closed-form solutions are derived for the run-length distribution, average run length (ARL), and standard deviation of the run length (SRL) for any AR(p) process, and approximate solutions are derived for the more general ARMA(p,q) processes. The expressions derived do not depend on the type of shift in the process mean. Numerical results are illustrated for the ARL and SRL of the ARMA(l,l) model, given that the shift in the mean is a step shift. These results show that the ARL and SRL of the specialcause control chart are relatively smaller when the process is negatively rather than positively autocorrelated. Regardless of the sign of the autocorrelation, the shape of the probability mass function of the run length reveals that the probability of detecting shifts very early is substantially higher for the special-cause chart than for more traditional control charts. Early detection makes the cause of the signal easier to identify, resulting in a more rapid rate of continuous quality improvement. There are some cases, however, when traditional charts, which are simpler to implement, should be considered even when the process is autocorrelated.},

  abstract = {Recently, several new applications of control chart procedures for short production runs have been introduced. Bothe (1989) and Burr (1989) proposed the use of control chart statistics which are obtained by scaling the quality characteristic by target values or process estimates of a location and scale parameter. The performance of these control charts can be significantly affected by the use of incorrect scaling parameters, resulting in either an excessive "false alarm rate," or insensitivity to the detection of moderate shifts in the process. To correct for these deficiencies, Quesenberry (1990, 1991) has developed the Q-Chart which is formed from running process estimates of the sample mean and variance. For the case where both the process mean and variance are unknown, the Q-chaxt statistic is formed from the standard inverse Z-transformation of a t-statistic. Q-charts do not perform correctly, however, in the presence of special cause disturbances at process startup. This has recently been supported by results published by Del Castillo and Montgomery (1992), who recommend the use of an alternative control chart procedure which is based upon a first-order adaptive Kalman filter model Consistent with the recommendations by Castillo and Montgomery, we propose an alternative short run control chart procedure which is based upon the second order dynamic linear model (DLM). The control chart is shown to be useful for the early detection of unwanted process trends. Model and control chart parameters are updated sequentially in a Bayesian estimation framework, providing the greatest degree of flexibility in the level of prior information which is incorporated into the model. The result is a weighted moving average control chart statistic which can be used to provide running estimates of process capability. The average run length performance of the control chart is compared to the optimal performance of the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart, as reported by Gan (1991). Using a simulation approach, the second order DLM control chart is shown to provide better overall performance than the EWMA for short production run applications},

Under stationary conditions, the statistic used for updating the estimate of the posterior mean of the process is just the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart statistic. As such, an adaptation of the EWMA chart, referred to within as a dynamic EWMA chart, is proposed for monitoring short production runs. The model is driven by a specification of a prior distribution in the mean and variance of the process. Simple approximations are developed for the posterior estimates of the model parameters to enable its use by shop floor personnel. It is based upon specifications in the sensitivity of the control chart procedure to special cause phenomena when the chart is operated in its stationary phase. An i.i.d. process is simulated to determine the required control chart standard deviation multiplier to achieve an in-control average run length (ARL) of 500. The results of simulation runs of 5000 replicates are evaluated for a range of settings of the EWMA weighting factor.},

  abstract = {We describe a new class of learning models called memory networks. Memory networks reason with inference components combined with a long-term memory component; they learn how to use these jointly. The long-term memory can be read and written to, with the goal of using it for prediction. We investigate these models in the context of question answering (QA) where the long-term memory effectively acts as a (dynamic) knowledge base, and the output is a textual response. We evaluate them on a large-scale QA task, and a smaller, but more complex, toy task generated from a simulated world. In the latter, we show the reasoning power of such models by chaining multiple supporting sentences to answer questions that require understanding the intension of verbs.},

  abstract = {The concept of frailty offers a convenient way to introduce unobserved heterogeneity and associations into models for survival data. In its simplest form, frailty is an unobserved random proportionality factor that modifies the hazard function of an individual or a group of related individuals. Frailty Models in Survival Analysis presents a comprehensive overview of the fundamental approaches in the area of frailty models. The book extensively explores how univariate frailty models can represent unobserved heterogeneity. It also emphasizes correlated frailty models as extensions of univariate and shared frailty models. The author analyzes similarities and differences between frailty and copula models; discusses problems related to frailty models, such as tests for homogeneity; and describes parametric and semiparametric models using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. He also shows how to apply the models to real data using the statistical packages of R, SAS, and Stata. The appendix provides the technical mathematical results used throughout. Written in nontechnical terms accessible to nonspecialists, this book explains the basic ideas in frailty modeling and statistical techniques, with a focus on real-world data application and interpretation of the results. By applying several models to the same data, it allows for the comparison of their advantages and limitations under varying model assumptions. The book also employs simulations to analyze the finite sample size performance of the models.},

  abstract = {Geopolitics and geoeconomics are often addressed together, with the latter seen as a sub-variant of the former. This article shows the usefulness of differentiating them at a conceptual level. By juxtaposing traditional geopolitics and geoeconomics, we suggest that they have remarkably different qualities and implications for their targets, on both national and international levels. Importantly, these include the formation of alliances, and whether they are driven by balancing, bandwagoning or underbalancing dynamics. An analysis of Russia's shifting geostrategy towards Europe shows these differences in practice. Russian geoeconomics has long been successful as a `wedge strategy', dividing the EU. As a result, the EU has underbalanced and its Russia policies have been incoherent. The observable tendencies in 2014\textendash 15 towards a more coherent European approach can be explained by the changing emphasis in Russia's geostrategy. Russia's turn to geopolitics works as a centripetal force, causing a relative increase in EU unity. Centripetal tendencies due to heightened threat perception can be observed in the economic sanctions, emerging German leadership in EU foreign policy, and discussion on energy union. The analysis calls for more attention to the way strategic choices\textemdash geopolitics versus geoeconomics\textemdash affect the coherence of threatened states and alliance patterns.},

The first four chapters discuss the two main pillars of the subject that have been developed over the last 60 years: vector autoregressive modeling and multivariate spectral analysis. These chapters provide the foundational material for the remaining chapters, which cover the construction of structural models and the extension of vector autoregressive modeling to high frequency, continuously recorded, and irregularly sampled series. The final chapter combines these approaches with spectral methods for identifying causal dependence between time series.

This approach entails estimating the inverse covariance matrix under a multivariate normal model by maximizing the {$\mathscr{l}$} 1 -penalized log-likelihood. We present a very simple necessary and sufficient condition that can be used to identify the connected components in the graphical lasso solution. The condition can be employed to determine whether the estimated inverse covariance matrix will be block diagonal, and if so, then to identify the blocks. This in turn can lead to drastic speed improvements, since one can simply apply a standard graphical lasso algorithm to each block separately. Moreover, the necessary and sufficient condition provides insight into the graphical lasso solution: the set of connected nodes at any given tuning parameter value is a superset of the set of connected nodes at any larger tuning parameter value.

  abstract = {Cluster-extent based thresholding is currently the most popular method for multiple comparisons correction of statistical maps in neuroimaging studies, due to its high sensitivity to weak and diffuse signals. However, cluster-extent based thresholding provides low spatial specificity; researchers can only infer that there is signal somewhere within a significant cluster and cannot make inferences about the statistical significance of specific locations within the cluster. This poses a particular problem when one uses a liberal cluster-defining primary threshold (i.e., higher p-values), which often produces large clusters spanning multiple anatomical regions. In such cases, it is impossible to reliably infer which anatomical regions show true effects. From a survey of 814 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies published in 2010 and 2011, we show that the use of liberal primary thresholds (e.g., p{$<$}.01) is endemic, and that the largest determinant of the primary threshold level is the default option in the software used. We illustrate the problems with liberal primary thresholds using an fMRI dataset from our laboratory (N=33), and present simulations demonstrating the detrimental effects of liberal primary thresholds on false positives, localization, and interpretation of fMRI findings. To avoid these pitfalls, we recommend several analysis and reporting procedures, including 1) setting primary p{$<$}.001 as a default lower limit; 2) using more stringent primary thresholds or voxel-wise correction methods for highly powered studies; and 3) adopting reporting practices that make the level of spatial precision transparent to readers. We also suggest alternative and supplementary analysis methods.},

While maintaining the same easy-to-follow style as the previous editions, this book continues to present an integrated system of experimental design and analysis that can be applied across various fields of research including engineering, medicine, and the physical sciences. New chapters provide modern updates on practical optimal design and computer experiments, an explanation of computer simulations as an alternative to physical experiments. Each chapter begins with a real-world example of an experiment followed by the methods required to design that type of experiment. The chapters conclude with an application of the methods to the experiment, bridging the gap between theory and practice. The authors modernize accepted methodologies while refining many cutting-edge topics including robust parameter design, analysis of non-normal data, analysis of experiments with complex aliasing, multilevel designs, minimum aberration designs, and orthogonal arrays. The third edition includes:  Information on the design and analysis of computer experiments A discussion of practical optimal design of experiments An introduction to conditional main effect (CME) analysis and definitive screening designs (DSDs) New exercise problems  This book includes valuable exercises and problems, allowing the reader to gauge their progress and retention of the book's subject matter as they complete each chapter. Drawing on examples from their combined years of working with industrial clients, the authors present many cutting-edge topics in a single, easily accessible source. Extensive case studies, including goals, data, and experimental designs, are also included, and the book's data sets can be found on a related FTP site, along with additional supplemental material. Chapter summaries provide a succinct outline of discussed methods, and extensive appendices direct readers to resources for further study. Experiments: Planning, Analysis, and Optimization, Third Edition is an excellent book for design of experiments courses at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels.

In this paper, we extend the Thompson sampling to Budgeted MAB, where there is random cost for pulling an arm and the total cost is constrained by a budget. We start with the case of Bernoulli bandits, in which the random rewards (costs) of an arm are independently sampled from a Bernoulli distribution. To implement the Thompson sampling algorithm in this case, at each round, we sample two numbers from the posterior distributions of the reward and cost for each arm, obtain their ratio, select the arm with the maximum ratio, and then update the posterior distributions. We prove that the distribution-dependent regret bound of this algorithm is \$O(\textbackslash ln B)\$, where \$B\$ denotes the budget. By introducing a Bernoulli trial, we further extend this algorithm to the setting that the rewards (costs) are drawn from general distributions, and prove that its regret bound remains almost the same. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The player targets at maximizing her total expected reward under a budget constraint B for the pulling costs. We present a multiple ratio confidence bound policy: At each round, we first calculate a truncated upper (lower) confidence bound for the expected reward (cost) of each arm, and then pull the L arms with the maximum ratio of the sum of the upper confidence bounds of rewards to the sum of the lower confidence bounds of costs. We design a 0- 1 integer linear fractional programming oracle that can pick such the L arms within polynomial time. We prove that the regret of our policy is sublinear in general and is log-linear for certain parameter settings. We further consider two special cases of MP-BMABs: (1) We derive a lower bound for any consistent policy for MP-BMABs with Bernoulli reward and cost distributions. (2) We show that the proposed policy can also solve conventional budgeted MAB problem (a special case of MP-BMABs with L = 1) and provides better theoretical results than existing UCB-based pulling policies.},

In this article, we propose a nonparametric adaptive sampling (NAS) strategy to online monitor nonnormal big data streams in the context of limited resources, where only a subset of observations are available at each acquisition time. In particular, this proposed method integrates a rank-based CUSUM scheme and an innovative idea that corrects the anti-rank statistics with partial observations, which can effectively detect a wide range of possible mean shifts when data streams are exchangeable and follow arbitrary distributions. Two theoretical properties on the sampling layout of the proposed NAS algorithm are investigated when the process is in control and out of control. Both simulations and case studies are conducted under different scenarios to illustrate and evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

  abstract = {In applications, most processes for quality control and management are multivariate. Thus, multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) is an important research problem and has been discussed extensively in the literature. Early MSPC research is based on the assumptions that process observations at different time points are independent and they have a parametric distribution (e.g., Gaussian) when the process is in-control (IC). Recent MSPC research has lifted the ``parametric distribution'' assumption, and some nonparametric MSPC charts have been developed. These nonparametric MSPC charts, however, often requires the ``independent process observations'' assumption, which is rarely valid in practice because serial data correlation is common in a time series data. In the literature, it has been well demonstrated that a control chart who ignores serial data correlation would be unreliable to use when such data correlation exists. So far, we have not found any existing nonparametric MSPC charts that can accommodate serial data correlation properly. In this paper, we suggest a flexible nonparametric MSPC chart which can accommodate stationary serial data correlation properly. Numerical studies show that it performs well in different cases.},

  abstract = {In various manufacturing applications such as steel, composites, and textile production, anomaly detection in noisy images is of special importance. Although there are several methods for image denoising and anomaly detection, most of these perform denoising and detection sequentially, which affects detection accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, the low computational speed of some of these methods is a limitation for real-time inspection. In this article, we develop a novel methodology for anomaly detection in noisy images with smooth backgrounds. The proposed method, named smooth-sparse decomposition, exploits regularized high-dimensional regression to decompose an image and separate anomalous regions by solving a large-scale optimization problem. To enable the proposed method for real-time implementation, a fast algorithm for solving the optimization model is proposed. Using simulations and a case study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare it with existing methods. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of the detection accuracy as well as computation time.

  abstract = {This article focuses on monitoring nonparametric profile with time-varying sample sizes and random predictors. Traditional profile monitoring schemes, whose control limits are often determined before the monitoring initiates, are constructed based on perfect knowledge of profile sample sizes and predictors. In practice, however, our foreknowledge about future random sample sizes and predictors is seldom available. An inappropriate assumption or estimation of the sample sizes model and/or predictors distribution function may lead to unexpected performance of traditional control charts. To overcome this problem, we propose a kernel-based nonparametric profile monitoring scheme which integrates the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average procedure with the probability control limits. The success of the proposed chart lies in the use of dynamic control limits which are determined online, essentially aiming at guaranteeing the conditional probability that the charting statistic exceeds the control limit at present given that there is no alarm before the current time point to meet a pre-specified false alarm rate. The simulation studies show that the proposed control scheme has good in-control and out-of-control performances under various scenarios of time-varying sample sizes and random predictors.

  abstract = {Statistical process control (SPC) charts provide a powerful tool for monitoring production lines in manufacturing industries. They are also used widely in other applications, such as sequential monitoring of internet traffic flows, disease incidences, health care systems, and more. In practice, quality/performance variables are often affected in a complex way by many covariates, such as material, labor, weather conditions, social/economic conditions, and so forth. Among all these covariates, some could be observed, some might be difficult to observe, and the others might even be difficult for us to notice their existence. Intuitively, an SPC chart could be improved by using helpful information in covariates. However, because of the complex relationship between the quality/performance variables and the covariates, shifts in the quality/performance variables could be due to certain covariates whose data cannot be collected. On the other hand, shifts in some observable covariates may not necessarily cause shifts in the quality/performance variables. Thus, it is challenging to properly use covariate information for process monitoring in a general setting. This article suggests a method to handle this problem. An effective exponentially weighted moving average chart is developed, in which its weighting parameter is chosen large if the related covariates included in the collected data tend to have a shift and small otherwise. Because the covariate information is used in the weighting parameter only, the chart is designed solely for detecting shifts in the quality/performance variables, but it can react to a future shift in the quality/performance variables quickly because the helpful covariate information has been used in its observation weighting mechanism. Extensive numerical studies show that this method is effective in many different cases.},

  abstract = {Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts are widely used in manufacturing industry for monitoring the performance of sequential production processes over time. A common practice in using a control chart is to first collect samples and take measurements of certain quality variables from them at equally-spaced sampling times, and then make decisions about the process status by the chart based on the observed data. In some applications, however, the quality variables are associated with certain covariates, and it should improve the performance of an SPC chart if the covariate information can be used properly. Intuitively, if the covariate information indicates that the process under monitoring is likely to have a distributional shift soon based on the established relationship between the quality variables and the covariates, then it should benefit the process monitoring by collecting the next process observation sooner than usual. Motivated by this idea, we propose a general framework to design a variable-sampling control chart by using covariate information. Our proposed chart is self-starting and can well accommodate stationary short-range serial data correlation. It should be the first variable-sampling control chart in the literature that the sampling intervals are determined by the covariate information. Numerical studies show that the proposed method performs well in different cases considered.},

Such massive data, involving a large number of data streams with high sampling frequency, incur high costs on data collection, transmission, and analysis in practice. As a result, the resource constraint often restricts the data observability to only a subset of data streams at each data acquisition time, posing significant challenges in many online monitoring applications. Unfortunately, existing methods do not provide a general framework for monitoring heterogeneous data streams with partial observations. In this article, we propose a nonparametric monitoring and sampling algorithm to quickly detect abnormalities occurring to heterogeneous data streams. In particular, an approximation framework is incorporated with an antirank-based CUSUM procedure to collectively estimate the underlying status of all data streams based on partially observed data. Furthermore, an intelligent sampling strategy based on Thompson sampling is proposed to dynamically observe the informative data streams and balance between exploration and exploitation to facilitate quick anomaly detection. Theoretical justification of the proposed algorithm is also investigated. Both simulations and case studies are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.},

While France remains determined to deter major power threats, its main new preoccupation is deterring regional powers by making clear that it has developed more employable nuclear options. The innovations announced in January 2006 include the focus on deterring state sponsors of terrorism, the threat to attach an enemy's `capacity to act', the more discriminate and controllable employment options, the willingness to launch `final warning' strikes, the description of `strategic supplies' as a potential vital interest, and the presentation of nuclear deterrence as the foundation of a strategy of prevention and, when necessary, conventional military intervention. Several factors may have led Chirac to make the speech at this juncture. These include maintaining the credibility of deterrence and presidential power, sustaining the budgetary effort required for the nuclear posture, clarifying French deterrence doctrine for external and internal audiences, and sending a message of autonomy to Iran's and France's key European partners. The new doctrine's implications include its significance for deterrence and non-proliferation and for France's relations with its partners in NATO and the European Union.},

Machine learning provides more rational advice than humans are capable of in almost every aspect of daily life. However, despite this achievement, the design and training of neural networks are still challenging and unpredictable procedures. To lower the technical thresholds for common users, automated hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) has become a popular topic in both academic and industrial areas. This paper provides a review of the most essential topics on HPO. The first section introduces the key hyper-parameters related to model training and structure, and discusses their importance and methods to define the value range. Then, the research focuses on major optimization algorithms and their applicability, covering their efficiency and accuracy especially for deep learning networks. This study next reviews major services and toolkits for HPO, comparing their support for state-of-the-art searching algorithms, feasibility with major deep learning frameworks, and extensibility for new modules designed by users. The paper concludes with problems that exist when HPO is applied to deep learning, a comparison between optimization algorithms, and prominent approaches for model evaluation with limited computational resources.},

These checks on the process are traditionally done by T2, multivariate cusum, and multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control charts. These traditional SPC charts assume that the in-control true parameters are known exactly and use these assumed true values to set the control limits. The reality, however, is that true parameter values are seldom if ever known exactly; rather, they are commonly estimated from a Phase I sample. It is increasingly recognized that this Phase I study needs to involve large samples if the parameter estimates are to provide run behavior matching that of the known-parameter situation. But, apart from the general undesirability of large and thus expensive studies preliminary to actual charting, some industrial settings have a paucity of relevant data for estimating the process parameters. An attractive alternative to traditional charting methods when monitoring for a step change in the mean vector is an unknown-parameter likelihood ratio test for a change in mean of p-variate normal data. We have found that this approach description is able to control the run behavior despite the lack of a large Phase I sample.},

The algorithm is three-state sequential, based on Bayesian thinking. It accounts for non-stationarity, irregularity and seasonality, and captures serial structural details of an epidemic curve. At stage n, a trichotomous variable governing the states of an epidemic is defined, and a prior distribution for time-indexed serial readings is set. The technicality consists of finding a posterior state probability based on the observed data history, using the posterior as a prior distribution for stage n+1 and sequentially monitoring surges in posterior state probabilities. A sensitivity analysis for validation is conducted and analytical formulas for the predictive distribution are supplied for error management purposes. The method is applied to syndromic surveillance data gathered in the United States (US) District of Columbia metropolitan area.},

Finite mixture models, Dirichlet process mixture models, and Pitman--Yor process mixture models make this assumption, as do all other infinitely exchangeable clustering models. However, for some applications, this assumption is inappropriate. For example, when performing entity resolution, the size of each cluster should be unrelated to the size of the data set, and each cluster should contain a negligible fraction of the total number of data points. These applications require models that yield clusters whose sizes grow sublinearly with the size of the data set. We address this requirement by defining the microclustering property and introducing a new class of models that can exhibit this property. We compare models within this class to two commonly used clustering models using four entity-resolution data sets.},

This is a desirable property because early detection should make it easier to identify the cause of the shift, increasing the rate of continuous quality improvement. In addition, our analysis illustrates the importance of reacting immediately to out-of-control signals from the chart as compared to waiting for subsequent observations to confirm the presence of a shift.},

By accounting for the quality of the input to each stage, the procedure not only detects the presence of out-of-control conditions but also helps to identify the stages responsible for such departures. We extend previous research to the common case where the process parameters are unknown. An extensive performance study shows that the procedure is effective in detecting out-of-control conditions and that it convincingly outperforms existing methods.

One key challenge in outcome monitoring is the need of adjustment for patient base-line risks. Various control charting methods have been developed to conduct risk-adjusted outcome monitoring, but they all rely on the availability of a large number of historical data. We propose a Bayesian approach to this type of monitoring for cases where historical data are not available. In our approach, detection of change is formulated as a model-selection problem and solved using a popular Bayesian tool for variable selection, the Bayes factor. Issues in decision-making about whether there is a change point in the observed patient outcomes are addressed, including specification of priors and computation of Bayes factors. This approach is applied to a real data set on cardiac surgeries, and its performance under different parameter scenarios is studied through simulations.},

However, its applicability is limited to situations where units of product are inspected sequentially, or item by item. Motivated by real-life problems, this paper proposes an improved control charting technique for high-quality processes under group inspection. It integrates a self-starting feature and an approximately ARL- (average run length) unbiased design. The chart, named the CCCG chart, monitors the cumulative count of conforming samples until a non-conforming one is encountered. The `G' in the subscript stands for `Group'. The self-starting feature caters to the need in practice to start monitoring a production process as soon as possible. The approximately ARL-unbiased design is developed to significantly improve the chart's sensitivity to process deterioration compared with the conventional design. The performance of the CCCG chart in phase I when the control limits are sequentially updated has been examined. Simulated data examples are presented to demonstrate the use and efficiency of the proposed technique. The CCCG chart is a natural generalisation of the traditional CCC chart and thus includes the latter as a special case.},

In practice, however, the use of a fixed control limit for the chart leads to a quite variable in-control average run length performance for patient populations with different risk score distributions. To overcome this problem, we determine simulation-based dynamic probability control limits (DPCLs) patient-by-patient for the risk-adjusted Bernoulli CUSUM charts. By maintaining the probability of a false alarm at a constant level conditional on no false alarm for previous observations, our risk-adjusted CUSUM charts with DPCLs have consistent in-control performance at the desired level with approximately geometrically distributed run lengths. Our simulation results demonstrate that our method does not rely on any information or assumptions about the patients' risk distributions. The use of DPCLs for risk-adjusted Bernoulli CUSUM charts allows each chart to be designed for the corresponding particular sequence of patients for a surgeon or hospital.

From first-hand experience, we understand that a mechanism for such a purpose is very useful. This article is primarily focused on monitoring the shape parameter of a Weibull renewal process. We derive a novel statistic on the Weibull shape parameter making use of maximum likelihood theory, which is demonstrated to follow an approximately normal distribution. This desirable normality property makes the statistic well suited for use in monitoring the Weibull shape parameter. It also allows for a simple approach to constructing a Shewhart-type control chart, named the Beta chart. The parameter values required to design a Beta chart are provided. A self-starting procedure is also proposed for setting up the Phase I Beta chart. The Average Run Length (ARL) performance of the Beta chart is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulation. A comparison with a moving range exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart from the literature shows that the Beta chart has much better ARL performance when properly designed. Application examples, using both simulated and real data, demonstrate that the Beta chart is effective and makes good sense in real practice.},

Thus it is desirable to develop methodologies to use real-time sensor data for on-line system condition monitoring and anomaly detection. However, there are several challenges in developing an effective process monitoring system: (i) data streams generated by multiple sensors are high-dimensional profiles; (ii) sensor signals are affected by noise due to system-inherent variations; (iii) signals of different sensors have cluster-wise features; and (iv) an anomaly may cause only sparse changes of sensor signals. To address these challenges, this article presents a real-time multiple profiles sensor-based process monitoring system, which includes the following modules: (i) preprocessing sensor signals to remove inherent variations and conduct profile alignments, (ii) using multichannel functional principal component analysis (MFPCA)\textendash based methods to extract sensor features by considering cluster-wise between-sensor correlations, and (iii) constructing a monitoring scheme with the top-R strategy based on the extracted features, which has scalable detection power for different fault patterns. Finally, we implement and demonstrate the proposed framework using data from a real manufacturing system.},

In this paper, we propose to incorporate multi-armed bandit approaches into sequential change-point detection to develop an efficient bandit change-point detection algorithm. Our proposed algorithm, termed Thompson-Sampling-Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak (TSSRP), consists of two policies per time step: the adaptive sampling policy applies the Thompson Sampling algorithm to balance between exploration for acquiring long-term knowledge and exploitation for immediate reward gain, and the statistical decision policy fuses the local Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak statistics to determine whether to raise a global alarm by sum shrinkage techniques. Extensive numerical simulations and case studies demonstrate the statistical and computational efficiency of our proposed TSSRP algorithm.},

Unusual sensor readings, such as high temperature, excessive vibration, or low current, could trigger rule-based actions (also known as faults) that range from warning alarms to immediate shutdown of the asset to prevent potential damage. In the case study of this article, a wind park experienced a sudden surge in vibration-induced shutdowns. We utilize fault data logs from the park with the goal of detecting common change points across turbines. Another important goal is the localization of fault occurrences to an identifiable set of turbines. The literature on change point detection and localization for multiple assets is highly sparse. Our technical development is based on the generalized linear modeling framework. We combine well-known solutions to change point detection for a single asset with a heuristics-based approach to identify a common change point(s) for multiple assets. The performance of the proposed detection and localization algorithms is evaluated through synthetic (Monte Carlo) fault data streams. Several novel performance metrics are defined to characterize different aspects of a change point detection algorithm for multiple assets. For the case study example, the proposed methodology identified the change point and the subset of affected turbines with a high degree of accuracy. The problem described here warrants further study to accommodate general fault distributions, change point detection algorithms, and very large fleet sizes.},

Starting from a random initialization, Pathfinder locates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the optimizer. Pathfinder returns draws from the approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those from automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC runs, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors. Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or in minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL-divergence estimates are embarrassingly parallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the resampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with multiple cores.},

An intrinsic method has the computational advantage of avoiding the difficult part registration problem, necessary in previous SPC approaches of three-dimensional geometrical data, but inadequate if noncontact sensors are used. The approach estimates the spectrum of the Laplace\textendash Beltrami (LB) operator of the scanned parts and uses a multivariate nonparametric control chart for online process control. Our proposal brings SPC closer to computer vision and computer graphics methods aimed to detect large differences in shape (but not in size). However, the SPC problem differs in that small changes in either shape or size of the parts need to be detected, keeping a controllable false alarm rate and without completely filtering noise. An online or ``Phase II'' method and a scheme for starting up in the absence of prior data (``Phase I'') are presented. Comparison with earlier approaches that require registration shows the LB spectrum method to be more sensitive to rapidly detect small changes in shape and size, including the practical case when the sequence of part datasets is in the form of large, unequal size meshes. A post-alarm diagnostic method to investigate the location of defects on the surface of a part is also presented. While we focus in this article on surface (triangulation) data, the methods can also be applied to point cloud and voxel metrology data.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the analysis of extreme rainfall data, we introduce a general Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the probability distribution of extreme values of intermittent random sequences, a common problem in geophysical and environmental science settings. The approach presented here relaxes the asymptotic assumption typical of the traditional extreme value (EV) theory, and accounts for the possible underlying variability in the distribution of event magnitudes and occurrences, which are described through a latent temporal process. Focusing on daily rainfall extremes, the structure of the proposed model lends itself to incorporating prior geo-physical understanding of the rainfall process. By means of an extensive simulation study, we show that this methodology can significantly reduce estimation uncertainty with respect to Bayesian formulations of traditional asymptotic EV methods, particularly in the case of relatively small samples. The benefits of the approach are further illustrated with an application to a large data set of 479 long daily rainfall historical records from across the continental United States. By comparing measures of in-sample and out-of-sample predictive accuracy, we find that the model structure developed here, combined with the use of all available observations for inference, significantly improves robustness with respect to overfitting to the specific sample.},

The SPC problem with a nonlinear profile is particularly challenging. This article proposes a novel scheme to monitor changes in both the regression relationship and the variation of the profile online. It integrates the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average procedure with the generalized likelihood ratio test based on nonparametric regression. The proposed scheme not only provides an effective SPC solution to handle nonlinear profiles, which are common in industrial practice, but it also resolves the latent problem in popular parametric monitoring methods of being unable to detect certain types of changes due to a misspecified, out-of-control model. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed monitoring scheme. In addition, a systematic diagnostic approach is provided to locate the change point of the process and identify the type of change in the profile. Finally, a deep reactive ion-etching example from semiconductor manufacturing is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed monitoring and diagnostic approach.},

Statist.32 (2004) 928\textendash 961] which ensures the optimal large sample performance. Furthermore, the high-dimensionality often induces the collinearity problem, which should be properly handled by the ideal method. Many existing variable selection methods fail to achieve both goals simultaneously. In this paper, we propose the adaptive elastic-net that combines the strengths of the quadratic regularization and the adaptively weighted lasso shrinkage. Under weak regularity conditions, we establish the oracle property of the adaptive elastic-net. We show by simulations that the adaptive elastic-net deals with the collinearity problem better than the other oracle-like methods, thus enjoying much improved finite sample performance.},

Monitoring high-dimensional data streams has become increasingly important for real-time detection of abnormal activities in many data-rich applications. We are interested in detecting an occurring event as soon as possible, but we do not know which subset of data streams is affected by the event. By connecting to the problem of detecting heterogenous mixtures, a new control chart is developed based on a powerful goodness-of-fit test of the local cumulative sum statistics from each data stream. Numerical results show that the proposed method is able to balance the detection of various fractions of affected streams, and generally outperforms existing methods.
